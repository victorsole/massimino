# Publish your app

| **Important:** From August 2021, new apps are required to publish with the[Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle)on Google Play. New apps larger than 200 MB are now supported by either[Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/dynamic-delivery)or[Play Asset Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/asset-delivery). From June 2023, new and existing[TV apps are required to be published as App Bundles](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/tv-app-quality#SC-E1).

Publishing is the general process that makes your Android app available to users. When you publish an Android app, you do the following:

- **Prepare the app for release.**

  During the preparation step, you build a release version of your app.
- **Release the app to users.**

  During the release step, you publicize, sell, and distribute the release version of your app, which users can download and install on their Android-powered devices.

This page provides an overview of the process for preparing to publish your app. If you plan to publish on Google Play, read[Release with confidence](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist).

If you use a Continuous Integration server, you can configure it to automate the steps outlined here. You can also configure it to push builds to your[internal test distribution channel](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle#test_with_play).

## Prepare your app for release

Preparing your app for release is a multistep process involving the following tasks:

- **Configure your app for release.**

  At a minimum, you need to make sure that logging is disabled and removed and that your release variant has`debuggable false`for Groovy or`isDebuggable = false`for Kotlin script set. You should also[set your app's version information](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning).
- **Build and sign a release version of your app.**

  You can use the Gradle build files with the*release* build type to build and sign a release version of your app. For more information, see[Build and run your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio).
- **Test the release version of your app.**

  Before you distribute your app, you should thoroughly test the release version on at least one target handset device and one target tablet device.[Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/get-started)is useful for testing across a variety of devices and configurations.
- **Update app resources for release.**

  Make sure that all app resources, such as multimedia files and graphics, are updated and included with your app or staged on the proper production servers.
- **Prepare remote servers and services that your app depends on.**

  If your app depends on external servers or services, make sure they are secure and production ready.

You might need to perform several other tasks as part of the preparation process. For example, you need to create an account on the app marketplace you want to use, if you don't already have one. You also need to create an icon for your app, and you might want to prepare an End User License Agreement (EULA) to protect yourself, your organization, and your intellectual property.

To learn how to prepare your app for release, see[Prepare for release](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing)for step-by-step instructions for configuring and building a release version of your app.

When you are finished preparing your app for release, you have a signed APK file that you can distribute to users.

## Release your app to users

You can release your Android apps several ways. Typically, you release apps through an app marketplace such as[Google Play](https://play.google.com). You can also release apps on your own website or by sending an app directly to a user.

### Release through an app marketplace

If you want to distribute your apps to the broadest possible audience, release them through an app marketplace.

Google Play is the premier marketplace for Android apps and is particularly useful if you want to distribute your apps to a large global audience. However, you can distribute your apps through any app marketplace, and you can use multiple marketplaces.

#### Release your apps on Google Play

[Google Play](https://play.google.com)is a robust publishing platform that helps you publicize, sell, and distribute your Android apps to users around the world. When you release your apps through Google Play, you have access to a suite of developer tools that let you analyze your sales, identify market trends, and control who your apps are being distributed to.

Google Play also gives you access to several revenue-enhancing features such as[in-app billing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing)and[app licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing). The rich array of tools and features, coupled with numerous end-user community features, makes Google Play the premier marketplace for selling and buying Android apps.

[Releasing your app on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay)is a simple process that involves three basic steps:

- **Prepare promotional materials.**

  To fully leverage the marketing and publicity capabilities of Google Play, you need to create promotional materials for your app such as screenshots, videos, graphics, and promotional text.
- **Configure options and uploading assets.**

  Google Play lets you target your app to a worldwide pool of users and devices. By configuring various Google Play settings, you can choose the countries you want to reach, the listing languages you want to use, and the price you want to charge in each country.

  You can also configure listing details such as the app type, category, and content rating. When you are done configuring options, you can upload your promotional materials and your app as a draft app.
- **Publish the release version of your app.**

  If you are satisfied that your publishing settings are correctly configured and your uploaded app is ready to be released to the public, click**Publish**. Once it has passed Google Play review, your app will be live and available for download around the world.

For more information, see[How Google Play works](https://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay).

## Release through a website

If you don't want to release your app on a marketplace like Google Play, you can make the app available for download on your own website or server, including on a private or enterprise server.

To release through a website:

1. [Prepare your app for release](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing).
2. Host the release-ready APK file on your website.
3. Provide a download link to users.

When users browse to the download link from their Android-powered devices, the file is downloaded and the Android system automatically starts installing it on the device.

**Note:** The installation process will start automatically only if the user has configured their settings to allow the installation of apps from[unknown sources](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#unknown-sources).

Although it is relatively easy to release your app on your own website, it can be inefficient. For example, if you want to monetize your app, you need to process and track all financial transactions yourself, and you can't use Google Play's[in-app billing service](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing)to sell in-app products. You also can't use[app licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing)to help prevent unauthorized installation and use of your app.

## User opt-in for unknown apps and sources

Android protects users from inadvertent download and installation of apps from locations other than a trusted, first-party app store, such as Google Play. Android blocks such installs until the user opts into allowing the installation of apps from other sources. The opt-in process depends on the version of Android running on the user's device:  
![Screenshot showing the settings screen for accepting install of unknown apps from different sources.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/publishing/publishing_unknown_apps_sm.png)

**Figure 1.** The**Install unknown apps**system settings screen, where users grant permission for a particular source to install unknown apps.

- On devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, users must navigate to the**Install unknown apps**system settings screen to enable app installations from a particular source.
- On devices running Android 7.1.1 (API level 25) and lower, users must either enable the**Unknown sources**system setting or allow a single installation of an unknown app.

### Install unknown apps

On devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, users must grant permission to install apps from a source that isn't a first-party app store. To do so, they must enable the**Allow app installs** setting for that source within the**Install unknown apps**system settings screen, shown in figure 1.

**Note:** Users can change this setting for a particular source at any time. Therefore, a source that installs unknown apps should always call[canRequestPackageInstalls()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager#canRequestPackageInstalls())to check whether the user has granted that source permission to install unknown apps. If this method returns`false`, the source should prompt the user to re-enable the**Allow app installs**setting for that source.

### Unknown sources

![Screenshot showing the setting for accepting download and install of apps from unknown sources.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/publishing/publishing_unknown_sources_sm.png)

**Figure 2.** The**Unknown sources**setting determines whether users can install apps that aren't downloaded from Google Play.

To permit the installation of apps from non-first-party sources on devices running Android 7.1.1 (API level 25) and lower, users enable the**Unknown sources** setting in**Settings \> Security**, as shown in Figure 2.

When users attempt to install an unknown app on a device running Android 7.1.1 (API level 25) or lower, the system sometimes shows a dialog that asks the user whether they want to allow only one particular unknown app to be installed. In most cases, it is recommended that users allow only one unknown app installation at a time, if the option is available.

In either case, users need to make this configuration change before they can download and install unknown apps onto their devices.

**Note:**Some network providers don't let users install apps from unknown sources.

# Play Policy Insights in Android Studio

| **Note:** Play Policy Insights is only available in the latest stable channel version of Android Studio and major versions (including their patches) released in the previous 10 months. If you are using an older version of Android Studio, you will need to update to access Play Policy Insights. For more information, see[Android Studio and Cloud services compatibility](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases#service-compat).

Android Studio provides richer insights and guidance on Google Play policies that may impact your app. This information helps you build safer apps from the start, preventing issues that could disrupt your launch process and cost more time and resources to fix later on.

You can see Play Policy Insights as lint checks. These lint checks present the following information:

- An overview of the relevant policy.
- Dos and don'ts to avoid common pitfalls.
- Links to Play policy pages where you can find details and more helpful information and resources.

This feature is intended to provide helpful pre-review guidance so you can have smoother app submission experiences. It doesn't cover every policy, nor does it provide final app review decisions. Always review the full policy in the[Policy Center](https://play.google/developer-content-policy/)to ensure compliance.

To see if there are any Play Policy Insights for your project, go to**Code \> Inspect for Play Policy Insights** Insights appear in the**Problems**tool window and also as lint warnings in the corresponding files.
![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/ppi-window.png)

You can run the Play Policy Insights lint checks in your Continuous Integration (CI) builds by adding the latest version of the[com.google.play.policy.insights:insights-lint](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html?q=com.google.play.policy.insights#com.google.play.policy.insights:insights-lint)library to your project dependencies (as a`lintChecks`dependency):  

    lintChecks("com.google.play.policy.insights:insights-lint:LATEST_VERSION")

and[setting up lint](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint#commandline)to run as part of your CI builds.

## Understand Play Policy Insights lint checks

Unlike traditional lint checks that often suggest specific code changes or quick fixes, Play Policy Insights lint checks operate differently. Their primary purpose is to make you aware of potential policy issues related to certain permissions or functionalities within the application. The goal is for you to be able to do the following:

- **Understand**the potential policy implications.
- **Make necessary changes**to their app's design or implementation to ensure compliance. Some of the insights may not be fully resolvable in Android Studio and may require actions in the Google Play Console.

These insights are designed to provide early warnings and guide you toward policy-compliant practices from the outset of the development process. Therefore, quick fixes don't exist for Play Policy Insights lint checks in the same way they do for other lint warnings. Instead, these insights should prompt a deeper review of your app's intended behavior and its alignment with Google Play policies.

## Disable Play Policy Insights lint checks

You can disable lint checks for the Play Policy Insights feature by unchecking them in the default inspection profile. To do this, navigate to**File \> Settings \> Editor \> Inspections** (on Windows/Linux) or**Android Studio \> Settings \> Editor \> Inspections** (on macOS). From there, you can disable individual Play Policy Insights checks under**Android \> Lint \> Play Policy**.
![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/ppi-disable.png)**Caution:** Disabling these lint checks means that you won't receive proactive policy guidance within Android Studio, which may increase the risk of encountering policy compliance issues during app submission.

## Feedback

We are continuously working to improve the Play Policy Insights feature. Your feedback is valuable in shaping its future development. If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues, please[report them](https://developer.android.com/studio/report-bugs).

# Prepare your app for release

| Android developer verification is a new requirement designed to link individuals and organizations to their Android apps. Starting in 2026, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed by users on certified Android devices. To learn what you need to do, see[Android developer verification](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides).

To prepare your app for release, you need to configure, build, and test a release version of your app. The configuration tasks involve basic code cleanup and code modification tasks that help optimize your app. The build process is similar to the debug build process and can be done using JDK and Android SDK tools.

Testing tasks serve as a final check, helping ensure that your app performs as expected under real-world conditions. Firebase offers a large set of both physical and virtual test devices through[Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/products/test-lab)that you can use to improve your app quality.

When you are finished preparing your app for release, you have a signed APK file, which you can distribute directly to users or distribute through an app marketplace such as[Google Play](https://play.google.com).

This document summarizes the main tasks you need to perform to prepare your app for release. The tasks described on this page apply to all Android apps, regardless of how they are released or distributed to users. If you are releasing your app through Google Play, read[Release with confidence](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist).

**Note:**As a best practice, make sure your app meets all of your release criteria for functionality, performance, and stability before you perform the tasks outlined on this page.
![Shows how the preparation process fits into the development process](https://developer.android.com/static/images/publishing/publishing_overview_prep.png)

**Figure 1.**Preparing for release is a required development task and is the first step in the publishing process.

## Tasks to prepare for release

To release your app to users, you need to create a release-ready package that users can install and run on their Android-powered devices. The release-ready package contains the same components as the debug APK file---compiled source code, resources, manifest file, and so on---and is built using the same build tools. However, unlike the debug APK file, the release-ready APK file is signed with your own certificate and is optimized with the`zipalign`tool.  
![Shows the five tasks you perform to prepare your app for release](https://developer.android.com/static/images/publishing/publishing_preparing.png)

**Figure 2.**There are five main tasks to prepare your app for release.

The signing and optimization tasks are usually seamless if you are building your app with Android Studio. For example, you can use Android Studio with the Gradle build files to compile, sign, and optimize your app all at once. You can also configure the Gradle build files to do the same when you build from the command line. For more details about using the Gradle build files, see[Configure your build](https://developer.android.com/studio/build).

To prepare your app for release, you typically perform five main tasks, as shown in figure 2. Each main task may include one or more smaller tasks, depending on how you are releasing your app. For example, if you are releasing your app through Google Play, you may want to add special filtering rules to your manifest while you are configuring your app for release. Similarly, to meet Google Play publishing guidelines you may have to prepare screenshots and create promotional text while you are gathering materials for release.

You usually perform the tasks listed in figure 2 after you have throroughly debugged and tested your app. The Android SDK contains several tools to help you test and debug your Android apps. For more information, see[Debug your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/debugging)and[Test your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/testing).

## Gather materials and resources

To prepare your app for release, you need to gather several supporting items. At a minimum, this includes cryptographic keys for signing your app and an app icon. You might also want to include an end-user license agreement.

### Cryptographic keys

Android requires that all APKs are digitally signed with a certificate before they are installed on a device or updated. For[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com), all apps created after August 2021 are required to use[Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#app-signing-google-play). But uploading your AAB to Play Console still requires you to sign it with your developer certificate. Older apps can still self-sign, but whether you're using Play App Signing or you're self-signing, you must sign your app before you can upload it.

To learn about certificate requirements, see[Sign your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing).

**Important:**Your app must be signed with a cryptographic key that has a validity period ending after October 22, 2033.

You might also have to obtain other release keys if your app accesses a service or uses a third-party library that requires you to use a key that is based on your private key.

### App icon

Your app's icon helps users identify your app on a device's Home screen and in the Launcher window. It also appears in Manage Applications, My Downloads, and elsewhere. In addition, publishing services such as Google Play display your icon to users. Be sure you have an app icon and that it meets the recommended[icon guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#design-principles).

**Note:** If you are releasing your app on Google Play, you need to create a high-resolution version of your icon. See[Add preview assests to showcase your app](https://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/developer/bin/answer.py?answer=1078870)for more information.

### End-user license agreement

Consider preparing an end-user license agreement (EULA) for your app. A EULA can help protect your person, organization, and intellectual property, and we recommend that you provide one with your app.

### Miscellaneous materials

You might also have to prepare promotional and marketing materials to publicize your app. For example, if you are releasing your app on Google Play, you will need to prepare some promotional text and you will need to create screenshots of your app. For more information, see[Add preview assets to showcase your app](https://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/developer/bin/answer.py?answer=1078870).

## Configure your app for release

After you gather all of your supporting materials, you can start configuring your app for release. This section provides a summary of the configuration changes we recommend that you make to your source code, resource files, and app manifest prior to releasing your app.

Although most of the configuration changes listed in this section are optional, they are considered good coding practices and we encourage you to implement them. In some cases, you might already have made these configuration changes as part of your development process.

### Choose a suitable application ID

Make sure you choose an application ID that is suitable over the life of your app. You can't change the application ID after you distribute your app to users. To set it, use the`applicationId`property in the module-level`build.gradle`or`build.gradle.kts`file. For more information, see[Set the application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id).

### Turn off debugging

To configure whether the APK is debuggable, use the`debuggable`flag for Groovy or the`isDebuggable`flag for Kotlin script:

<br />

### Kotlin

```kotlin
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
      release {
        isDebuggable = false
        ...
      }
      debug {
        isDebuggable = true
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  
```

### Groovy

```groovy
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
      release {
        debuggable false
        ...
      }
      debug {
        debuggable true
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }
```

### Enable and configure app shrinking

Many of the following optimizations can be automated by enabling[shrinking](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code)for your release build. For example, you can add ProGuard rules to remove log statements, and the shrinker will identify and remove unused code and resources. The shrinker can also replace class and variable names with shorter names to further reduce DEX size.

### Turn off logging

Deactivate logging before you build your app for release. You can deactivate logging by removing calls to[Log](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log)methods in your source files. Also, remove any log files or static test files that were created in your project.

Also, remove all[Debug](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug)tracing calls that you added to your code, such as[startMethodTracing()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug#startMethodTracing())and[stopMethodTracing()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug#stopMethodTracing())method calls.

**Important:** Ensure that you disable debugging for your app if using[WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView)to display paid content or if using JavaScript interfaces, because debugging lets users inject scripts and extract content using Chrome DevTools. To disable debugging, use the[WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView#setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(boolean))method.

### Clean up your project directories

Clean up your project and make sure it conforms to the directory structure described in[Projects overview](https://developer.android.com/tools/projects#ApplicationProjects). Leaving stray or orphaned files in your project can prevent your app from compiling and cause your app to behave unpredictably. At a minimum, perform the following cleanup tasks:

- Review the contents of your`cpp/`,`lib/`, and`src/`directories. The`cpp/`directory should contain only source files associated with the[Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk), such as C or C++ source files, header files, or makefiles. The`lib/`directory should contain only third-party library files or private library files, including prebuilt shared and static libraries. The`src/`directory should contain only the source files for your app (Java, Kotlin, and AIDL files). The`src/`directory should not contain any JAR files.
- Check your project for private or proprietary data files that your app doesn't use and remove them. For example, look in your project's`res/`directory for old drawable files, layout files, and values files that you are no longer using and delete them.
- Check your`lib/`directory for test libraries and remove them if they are no longer being used by your app.
- Review the contents of your`assets/`directory and your`res/raw/`directory for raw asset files and static files that you need to update or remove prior to release.

### Review and update your manifest and Gradle build settings

Verify that the following manifest and build files items are set correctly:

- [<uses-permission>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-permission-element)element

  Specify only those permissions that are relevant and required for your app.
- `android:icon`and`android:label`attributes

  You must specify values for these attributes, which are located in the[<application>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element)element.
- `versionCode`and`versionName`properties

  We recommend that you specify values for these properties, which are located in the app module-level`build.gradle`or`build.gradle.kts`file. For more information, see[Version your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/versioning).

There are several additional build file elements that you can set if you are releasing your app on Google Play. For example, the`minSdk`and`targetSdk`attributes, which are located in the app module-level`build.gradle`or`build.gradle.kts`file. For more information about these and other Google Play settings, see[Filters on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/google/play/filters).

### Address compatibility issues

Android provides several tools and techniques to make your app compatible with a wide range of devices. To make your app available to the largest number of users, consider doing the following:

Add support for multiple screen configurations.
:   Make sure you meet the best practices for[supporting multiple screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support#screen-independence). By supporting multiple screen configurations, you can create an app that functions properly and looks good on any of the screen sizes supported by Android.

Optimize your app for larger displays.
:   You can optimize your app to work well on devices with large displays such as tablets and foldables. For example,[list-detail layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/large-screen-canonical-layouts#list-detail)can improve usability on larger screens.

Consider using Jetpack libraries.
:   Jetpack is a suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices.

### Update URLs for servers and services

If your app accesses remote servers or services, make sure you are using the production URL or path for the server or service and not a test URL or path.

### Implement licensing for Google Play

If you are releasing a paid app through Google Play, consider adding support for Google Play Licensing. Licensing lets you control access to your app based on whether the current user has purchased it. Using Google Play Licensing is optional, even if you are releasing your app through Google Play.

For more information about the Google Play Licensing Service and how to use it in your app, see[App Licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing).

## Build your app for release

After you finish configuring your app, you can build it into a release-ready APK file that is signed and optimized. The JDK includes the tools for signing the APK file (Keytool and Jarsigner); the Android SDK includes the tools for compiling and optimizing the APK file. If you are using Android Studio or you are using the Gradle build system from the command line, you can automate the entire build process. For more information about configuring Gradle builds, see[Configure build variants](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle).

If you are using a[continuous integration system](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/continuous-integration), you can configure a task to automate your release process. This is not limited to building your release APK or AAB. You can also configure it to automatically upload the build artifact(s) to Play Console.

### Build with Android Studio

You can use the Gradle build system, integrated with Android Studio, to build a release-ready APK file that is signed with your private key and optimized. To learn how to set up and run builds from Android Studio, see[Build and run your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio).

The build process assumes that you have a certificate and private key suitable for signing your app. If you don't have a suitable certificate and private key, Android Studio can help you generate one. For more information about the signing process, see[Sign your app](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing).

## Prepare external servers and resources

If your app relies on a remote server, make sure the server is secure and that it is configured for production use. This is particularly important if you are implementing[in-app billing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing)in your app and you are performing the signature verification step on a remote server.

Also, if your app fetches content from a remote server or a real-time service (such as a content feed), be sure the content you are providing is up to date and production ready.

## Test your app for release

Testing the release version of your app helps ensure that your app runs properly under realistic device and network conditions. Ideally, test your app on at least one handset-sized device and one tablet-sized device to verify that your user interface elements are sized correctly and that your app's performance and battery efficiency are acceptable.[Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab)can also be useful for testing across a variety of different devices and Android OS versions.

As a starting point for testing, see[Core app quality](https://developer.android.com/tools/testing/what_to_test). When you are done testing and satisfied that the release version of your app behaves correctly, you can release your app to users. For more information, see[Release your app to users](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/publishing_overview#publishing-release).

https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

# Version your app

Versioning is a critical component of your app upgrade and maintenance strategy. Versioning is important because:

- Users need to have specific information about the app version that is installed on their devices and the upgrade versions available for installation.
- Other apps---including other apps that you publish as a suite---need to query the system for your app's version to determine compatibility and identify dependencies.
- Services where you publish your app(s) may also need to query your app for its version so that they can display the version to users. A publishing service may also need to check the app version to determine compatibility and establish upgrade/downgrade relationships.

The Android system uses your app's version information to protect against downgrades. The system doesn't use app version information to enforce restrictions on upgrades or compatibility of third-party apps. Your app must enforce any version restrictions and tell users about them.

The Android system enforces system version compatibility, as expressed by the`minSdk`setting in the build files. This setting lets an app specify the minimum system API that it is compatible with. For more information about API requirements, see[Specify API level (SDK version) requirements](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning#minsdk).

Versioning requirements vary between different projects. However, many developers consider[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)a good basis for a versioning strategy.

## Set app version information

To define the version information for your app, set values for the version settings in the Gradle build files:  

### Groovy

```groovy
    android {
      namespace 'com.example.testapp'
      compileSdk 33

      defaultConfig {
          applicationId "com.example.testapp"
          minSdk 24
          targetSdk 33
          versionCode 1
          versionName "1.0"
          ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ...
    
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
    android {
      namespace = "com.example.testapp"
      compileSdk = 33

      defaultConfig {
          applicationId = "com.example.testapp"
          minSdk = 24
          targetSdk = 33
          versionCode = 1
          versionName = "1.0"
          ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ...
      
```

### Version settings

Define values for both of the version settings available:`versionCode`and`versionName`.

`versionCode`
:   A positive integer used as an internal version number. This number helps determine whether one version is more recent than another, with higher numbers indicating more recent versions. This is not the version number shown to users; that number is set by the`versionName`setting. The Android system uses the`versionCode`value to protect against downgrades by preventing users from installing an APK with a lower`versionCode`than the version currently installed on their device.

    The value is a positive integer so that other apps can programmatically evaluate it---to check an upgrade or downgrade relationship, for instance. You can set the value to any positive integer. However, make sure that each successive release of your app uses a greater value.

    **Note:** The greatest value Google Play allows for`versionCode`is 2100000000.

    You can't upload an APK to the Play Store with a`versionCode`you have already used for a previous version.

    **Note:** In some situations, you might want to upload a version of your app with a lower`versionCode`than the most recent version. For example, if you are publishing multiple APKs, you might have pre-set`versionCode`ranges for specific APKs. For more about assigning`versionCode`values for multiple APKs, see[Assigning version codes](https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks#VersionCodes).

    Typically, you release the first version of your app with`versionCode`set to 1, then monotonically increase the value with each release, regardless of whether the release constitutes a major or minor release. This means that the`versionCode`value doesn't necessarily resemble the app release version that is visible to the user. Apps and publishing services shouldn't display this version value to users.

`versionName`

:   A string used as the version number shown to users. This setting can be specified as a raw string or as a reference to a string resource.

    The value is a string so that you can describe the app version as a \<major\>.\<minor\>.\<point\> string or as any other type of absolute or relative version identifier. The`versionName`is the only value displayed to users.

### Define version values

You can define default values for these settings by including them in the`defaultConfig {}`block, nested inside the`android {}`block of your module's`build.gradle`or`build.gradle.kts`file. You can then override these default values for different versions of your app by defining separate values for individual build types or product flavors. The following file shows the`versionCode`and`versionName`settings in the`defaultConfig {}`block, as well as the`productFlavors {}`block.

These values are then merged into your app's manifest file during the build process.  

### Groovy

```groovy
    android {
        ...
        defaultConfig {
            ...
            versionCode 2
            versionName "1.1"
        }
        productFlavors {
            demo {
                ...
                versionName "1.1-demo"
            }
            full {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
    android {
        ...
        defaultConfig {
            ...
            versionCode = 2
            versionName = "1.1"
        }
        productFlavors {
            create("demo") {
                ...
                versionName = "1.1-demo"
            }
            create("full") {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    
```

In the`defaultConfig {}`block of this example, the`versionCode`value indicates that the current APK contains the second release of the app, and the`versionName`string specifies that it will appear to users as version 1.1. This file also defines two product flavors, "demo" and "full." Since the "demo" product flavor defines`versionName`as "1.1-demo", the "demo" build uses this`versionName`instead of the default value. The "full" product flavor block doesn't define`versionName`, so it uses the default value of "1.1".

**Note:** If your app defines the app version directly in the`<manifest>`element, the version values in the Gradle build file override the settings in the manifest. Additionally, defining these settings in the Gradle build files lets you specify different values for different versions of your app. For greater flexibility and to avoid potential overwriting when the manifest is merged, remove these attributes from the`<manifest>`element and define your version settings in the Gradle build files instead.

The Android framework provides an API to let you query the system for version information about your app. To obtain version information, use the[PackageManager.getPackageInfo(java.lang.String, int)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager#getPackageInfo(java.lang.String,%20android.content.pm.PackageManager.PackageInfoFlags))method.

## Specify API level (SDK version) requirements

If your app requires a specific minimum version of the Android platform, you can specify that version requirement as API level settings in the app's`build.gradle`or`build.gradle.kts`file. During the build process, these settings are merged into your app's manifest file. Specifying API level requirements ensures that your app can only be installed on devices that are running a compatible version of the Android platform.

**Note:** If you specify API level requirements directly in your app's manifest file, the corresponding settings in the build files will override the settings in the manifest file. Additionally, defining these settings in the Gradle build files lets you specify different values for different versions of your app. For greater flexibility and to avoid potential overwriting when the manifest is merged, remove these attributes from the`<uses-sdk>`element and define your API level settings in the Gradle build files instead.

There are two API level settings available:

- `minSdk`--- The minimum version of the Android platform on which the app will run, specified by the platform's API level identifier.
- `targetSdk`--- The API level, tied to the[`<SDK_INT>`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#SDK_INT)constant, on which the app is designed to run. In some cases, this allows the app to use manifest elements or behaviors defined in the target API level, rather than being restricted to using only those defined for the minimum API level.
- It is not possible to specify that an app either targets or requires a minor SDK version. To call new APIs safely that require a higher major or minor SDK version than your`minSdkVersion`, you can guard a code block with a check for a minor or major release using the`SDK_INT_FULL`constant.  

```kotlin
if (SDK_INT_FULL >= VERSION_CODES_FULL.[MAJOR or MINOR RELEASE]) {
  // Use APIs introduced in a major or minor SDK version
}
```

To specify default API level requirements in a`build.gradle`or`build.gradle.kts`file, add one or more of the API level settings to the`defaultConfig{}`block, nested inside the`android {}`block. You can also override these default values for different versions of your app by adding the settings to build types or product flavors.

The following file specifies default`minSdk`and`targetSdk`settings in the`defaultConfig {}`block and overrides`minSdk`for one product flavor:  

### Groovy

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdk 21
        targetSdk 33
    }
    productFlavors {
        main {
            ...
        }
        afterNougat {
            ...
            minSdk 24
        }
    }
}
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdk = 21
        targetSdk = 33
    }
    productFlavors {
        create("main") {
            ...
        }
        create("afterNougat") {
            ...
            minSdk = 24
        }
    }
}
```

When preparing to install your app, the system checks the value of these settings and compares them to the system version. If the`minSdk`value is greater than the system version, the system prevents the installation of the app.

If you don't specify these settings, the system assumes that your app is compatible with all platform versions. This is equivalent to setting`minSdk`to`1`.

For more information, see[What is API Level?](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels). For Gradle build settings, see[Configure build variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants).

# Sign your app

Android requires that all APKs be digitally signed with a certificate before they are installed on a device or updated. When releasing using[Android App Bundles](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle), you need to sign your app bundle with an upload key before uploading it to the Play Console, and Play App Signing takes care of the rest. For apps distributing using APKs on the Play Store or on other stores, you must manually sign your APKs for upload.

This page guides you through some important concepts related to app signing and security, how to sign your app for release to Google Play using Android Studio, and how to configure Play App Signing.

The following is a high-level overview of the steps you might need to take to sign and publish a new app to Google Play:

1. [Generate an upload key and keystore](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)
2. [Sign your app with your upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign_release)
3. [Configure Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#enroll)
4. [Upload your app to Google Play](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle)
5. [Prepare \& roll out release of your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011)

If instead your app is already published to the Google Play Store with an existing app signing key, or you would like to choose the app signing key for a new app instead of having Google generate it, follow these steps:

1. [Sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign_release)with your app's*signing key*.
2. [Upload your app's signing key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#enroll_existing)to Play App Signing.
3. (Recommended)[Generate and register an upload certificate](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)for future updates to your app
4. [Upload your app to Google Play](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle)
5. [Prepare \& roll out release of your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011)

This page also explores how to manage your own keys for when uploading your app to other app stores. If you do not use Android Studio or would rather sign your app from the command line, learn about how to use[`apksigner`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner).
| **Note:** If you are building a Wear OS app, the process for signing the app can differ from the process described on this page. See the information about[packaging and publishing Wear OS apps](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/packaging).

## Play App Signing

With Play App Signing, Google manages and protects your app's signing key for you and uses it to sign your APKs for distribution. And, because app bundles defer building and signing APKs to the Google Play Store, you need to configure Play App Signing before you upload your app bundle. Doing so lets you benefit from the following:

- Use the Android App Bundle and support Google Play's advanced delivery modes. The Android App Bundle makes your app much smaller, your releases simpler, and makes it possible to use feature modules and offer instant experiences.
- Increase the security of your signing key, and make it possible to use a separate upload key to sign the app bundle you upload to Google Play.
- Key upgrade lets you change your app signing key in case your existing one is compromised or if you need to migrate to a cryptographically stronger key

  | **Note:** In order to ensure security, after you configure Play App Signing with either an auto-generated key, or a key that you supply, you cannot retrieve a copy of your app's signing key and Google may retain a backup copy of the key for disaster recovery purposes.

Play App Signing uses two keys: the*app signing key* and the*upload key* , which are described in further detail in the section about[Keys and keystores](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#certificates-keystores). You keep the upload key and use it to sign your app for upload to the Google Play Store. Google uses the upload certificate to verify your identity, and signs your APK(s) with your app signing key for distribution as shown in figure 1. By using a separate upload key you can[request an upload key reset](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423#reset)if your key is ever lost or compromised.

By comparison, for apps that have not opted in to Play App Signing, if you lose your app's signing key, you lose the ability to update your app.
| **Important:** If you want to use the same signing key across multiple stores, make sure to provide your own signing key when you[configure Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#enroll), instead of having Google generate one for you.

![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/appsigning_googleplayappsigningdiagram_2x.png)

**Figure 1**. Signing an app with Play App Signing

<br />

Your keys are stored on the same infrastructure that Google uses to store its own keys, where they are protected by Google's Key Management Service. You can learn more about Google's technical infrastructure by reading the[Google Cloud Security Whitepapers](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/security_whitepapers_march2018.pdf).

When you use Play App Signing, if you lose your upload key, or if it is compromised, you can request an upload key reset in the Play Console. Because your app signing key is secured by Google, you can continue to upload new versions of your app as updates to the original app, even if you change upload keys. To learn more, read[Reset a lost or compromised private upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#reset_upload_key).

The next section describes some important terms and concepts related to app signing and security. If you'd rather skip ahead and learn how to prepare your app for upload to the Google Play Store, go to[Sign your app for release](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk).

### Keystores, keys, and certificates

Java Keystores (.jks or .keystore) are binary files that serve as repositories of certificates and private keys.

A**public key certificate** (`.der`or`.pem`files), also known as a digital certificate or an identity certificate, contains the public key of a public/private key pair, as well as some other metadata identifying the owner (for example, name and location) who holds the corresponding private key.

The following are the different types of keys you should understand:

- **App signing key:**The key that is used to sign APKs that are installed on a user's device. As part of Android's secure update model, the signing key never changes during the lifetime of your app. The app signing key is private and must be kept secret. You can, however, share the certificate that is generated using your app signing key.
- **Upload key:** The key you use to sign the app bundle or APK before you upload it for[app signing with Google Play](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#app-signing-google-play). You must keep the upload key secret. However, you can share the certificate that is generated using your upload key. You may generate an upload key in one of the following ways:

  - If you choose for Google to generate the app signing key for you when you opt in, then the key you use to[sign your app for release](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk)is designated as your upload key.
  - If you provide the app signing key to Google when opting in your new or existing app, then you have the option to generate a new upload key during or after opting in for increased security.
  - If you do not generate a new upload key, you continue to use your app signing key as your upload key to sign each release.

  **Tip:**To keep your keys secure, it's a good idea to make sure your app signing key and upload key are different.

### Working with API providers

You can download the certificate for the app signing key and your upload key from the**Release \> Setup \> App signing** page in the[Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/). This is used to register public key(s) with API providers; it's intended to be shared, as it does not contain your private key.

A**certificate fingerprint** is a short and unique representation of a certificate that is often requested by API providers alongside the package name to register an app to use their service. The MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints of the upload and app signing certificates can be found on the app signing page of the Play Console. Other fingerprints can also be computed by downloading the original certificate (`.der`) from the same page.

## Sign your debug build

When running or debugging your project from the IDE, Android Studio automatically signs your app with a debug certificate generated by the Android SDK tools. The first time you run or debug your project in Android Studio, the IDE automatically creates the debug keystore and certificate in`$HOME/.android/debug.keystore`, and sets the keystore and key passwords.
| **Tip:** Your project's debug keystore may not be located in the default location. To confirm the location of your project's keystore in Android Studio 2024.2.1:
|
| 1. Open the Gradle Tool Window.
| 2. Select your proiect.
| 3. Expand the Gradle settings tree starting from**app** (**app** \>**tasks** \>**android**).
| 4. Under**android** , select**signingReport** .  
|    ![Screenshot of expanded project Gradle configuration tree](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/projects/project-gradle-configuration.png)
| 5. The Signing Report appears in the lower panel. Look for the line that starts with**Store** . This tells you the location of the`debug.keystore`file.

Because the debug certificate is created by the build tools and is insecure by design, most app stores (including the Google Play Store) do not accept apps signed with a debug certificate for publishing.

Android Studio automatically stores your debug signing information in a signing configuration so you do not have to enter it every time you debug. A signing configuration is an object consisting of all of the necessary information to sign your app, including the keystore location, keystore password, key name, and key password.

For more information about how to build and run apps for debugging, see[Build and Run Your App](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio).

### Expiry of the debug certificate

The self-signed certificate used to sign your app for debugging has an expiration date of 30 years from its creation date. When the certificate expires, you get a build error.

To fix this problem, simply delete the`debug.keystore`file stored in one of the following locations:

- `~/.android/`on OS X and Linux
- `C:\Documents and Settings\`<var translate="no">user</var>`\.android\`on Windows XP
- `C:\Users\`<var translate="no">user</var>`\.android\`on Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8, and 10

The next time you build*and run*a debug version of your app, Android Studio regenerates a new keystore and debug key.

## Sign your app for release to Google Play

When you are ready to publish your app, you need to sign your app and upload it to an app store, such as Google Play. When publishing your app to Google Play for the first time, you must also configure Play App Signing. Play App Signing is optional for apps created before August 2021. This section shows you how to properly sign your app for release and configure Play App Signing.

### Generate an upload key and keystore

If you don't already have an upload key, which is useful when configuring Play App Signing, you can generate one using Android Studio as follows:

1. In the menu bar, click**Build \> Generate Signed Bundle/APK**.
2. In the**Generate Signed Bundle or APK** dialog, select**Android App Bundle** or**APK** and click**Next**.
3. Below the field for**Key store path** , click**Create new**.
4. On the**New Key Store**window, provide the following information for your keystore and key, as shown in figure 2.

   ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/keystore-wizard_2x.png)

   **Figure 2.**Create a new upload key and keystore in Android Studio.
5. **Keystore**

   - **Key store path:** Select the location where your keystore should be created. Also, a file name should be added to the end of the location path with the`.jks`extension.
   - **Password:**Create and confirm a secure password for your keystore.
6. **Key**

   - **Alias:**Enter an identifying name for your key.
   - **Password:** Create and confirm a secure password for your key. This should be the same as your keystore password. (Please refer to the[known issue](https://developer.android.com/studio/known-issues#ki-key-keystore-warning)for more information)
   - **Validity (years):**Set the length of time in years that your key will be valid. Your key should be valid for at least 25 years, so you can sign app updates with the same key through the lifespan of your app.
   - **Certificate:**Enter some information about yourself for your certificate. This information is not displayed in your app, but is included in your certificate as part of the APK.
7. Once you complete the form, click**OK**.

8. If you would like to build and sign your app with your upload key, continue to the section about how to[Sign your app with your upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign_release). If you only want to generate the key and keystore, click**Cancel**.

### Sign your app with your key

If you already have an upload key, use it to sign your app. If instead your app is already signed and published to the Google Play store with an existing app signing key, use it to sign your app. You can later[generate and register a separate upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#register_upload_key)with Google Play to sign and upload subsequent updates to your app.

To sign your app using Android Studio, follow these steps:

1. If you don't currently have the**Generate Signed Bundle or APK** dialog open, click**Build \> Generate Signed Bundle/APK**.
2. In the**Generate Signed Bundle or APK** dialog, select either**Android App Bundle** or**APK** and click**Next**.
3. Select a module from the drop down.
4. Specify the path to your keystore, the alias for your key, and enter the passwords for both. If you haven't yet prepared your upload keystore and key, first[Generate an upload key and keystore](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)and then return to complete this step.

   ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/generate-signed-apk-wizard_2x.png)

   **Figure 3**. Sign your app with your upload key.

   <br />

   | **Note:** For increased security, Google Play is introducing a new process to upload signing keys, and the option**Export encrypted key** in Android Studio is being deprecated. If you're signing an app with an existing app signing key, and you'd like to opt your app in to Play App Signing, see[Opt in an existing app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#enroll_existing)for the process to encrypt and export your signing key.
5. Click**Next**.

6. In the next window (shown in figure 4), select a destination folder for your signed app, select the build type, choose the product flavor(s) if applicable.

7. If you are building and signing an APK, you need to select which**Signature Versions** you want your app to support. To learn more, read about[app signing schemes](https://source.android.com/security/apksigning)

   | **Note:** Google Play supports[APK Signature Scheme v3](https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/v3)for APKs that aren't already published with an existing[signing certificate lineage](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner#usage-rotate).
8. Click**Create**.

   | **Note:** If your project uses product flavors, you can select multiple product flavors while holding down the**Control** key on Windows/Linux, or the**Command**key on Mac OSX. Android Studio will generate a separate APK or app bundle for each product flavor you select.

![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/generate_signed_bundle_popup-2x.png)

**Figure 5.**Click the link in the popup to analyze or locate your app bundle.

After Android Studio finishes building your signed app, you can either**locate** or**analyze**your app by clicking on the appropriate option in the pop-up notification, as shown in figure 5.

Now you're ready to opt your app in to Play App Signing and upload your app for release. If you're new to the app publishing process, you may want to read the[Launch overview](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch). Otherwise, continue to the page about how to[Upload your app to the Play Console](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle).

## Using Play App Signing

As described earlier in this page, configuring[Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#app-signing-google-play)is required to sign your app for distribution through Google Play (except for apps created before August 2021, which may continue distributing self-signed APKs). The steps you need to take depend on whether your app has not yet been published to Google Play, or your app is already signed and was published before August 2021 using an existing app signing key.

### Configure a new app

To configure signing for an app that has not yet been published to Google Play, proceed as follows:

1. If you haven't already done so,[generate an upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)and[sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign_release)with that upload key.
2. Sign in to your[Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/).
3. Follow the steps to[prepare \& roll out your release](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011)to create a new release.
4. After you choose a release track, configure app signing under the**App signing** section as follows:
   - To have Google Play generate an app signing key for you and use it to sign your app, you don't have to do anything. The key you use to sign your first release becomes your upload key, and you should use it to sign future releases.
   - To use the same key as another app on your developer account, select**Change app signing key \> Use the same key as another app in this account** , select an app, and then click**Continue**.
   - To provide your own signing key for Google to use when signing your app, select**Change app signing key** and select one of the**Export and upload**options that lets you securely upload a private key and its public certificate.

| **Note:** If you haven't already accepted the[Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-app-signing-terms.html), you are required to review the terms and select**Accept**to continue.

In the section called**App Bundles** , click**Browse files** to locate and upload the app you signed using your upload key. For more information about releasing your app, refer to[prepare \& roll out your release](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011). When you release your app after configuring Play App Signing, Google Play generates (unless you upload an existing key) and manages your app's signing key for you. Simply sign subsequent updates to your app using your app's upload key before uploading it to Google Play.

If you need to create a new upload key for you app, go to the section about how to[Reset a lost or compromised private upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#reset_upload_key).

### Opt in an existing app

If you're updating an app that's already published to Google Play using an existing app signing key, you can opt in to Play App Signing as follows:

1. Sign in to your[Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)and navigate to your app.
2. On the left menu, click**Release \> Setup \> App signing**.
3. If applicable, review the Terms of Service and select**Accept**.
4. Select one of the options that best describes the signing key you want to upload to Google Play and follow the instructions that are shown. For example, if you are using a Java Keystore for your signing key, select**Upload a new app signing key from Java Keystore**and follow the instructions to download and run the PEPK tool, and upload the generated file with your encrypted key.
5. Click**Enroll**.

You should now see a page with the details of your app's signing and upload certificates. Google Play now signs your app with your existing key when deploying it to users. However, one of the most important benefits to Play App Signing is the ability to separate the key you use to sign the artifact you upload to Google Play from the key that Google Play uses to sign your app for distribution to users. So, consider following the steps in the next section to generate and register a separate upload key.

#### Generate and register an upload certificate

When you're publishing an app that is not signed by an upload key, the Google Play Console provides the option to register one for future updates to the app. Although this is an optional step, it's recommended that you publish your app with a key that's separate from the one Google Play uses to distribute your app to users. That way, Google keeps your signing key secure, and you have the option to[reset a lost or compromised private upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#reset_upload_key). This section describes how to create an upload key, generate an upload certificate from it, and register that certificate with Google Play for future updates of your app.

The following describes the situations in which you see the option to register an upload certificate in the Play Console:

- When you publish a new app that's signed with a signing key and opt it in to Play App Signing.
- When you are about to publish an existing app that's already opted in to Play App Signing, but it is signed using its signing key.

If you are not publishing an update to an existing app that's already opted in to Play App Signing, and you'd like to register an upload certificate, complete the steps below and continue on to the section about how to[reset a lost or compromised private upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#reset_upload_key).

If you haven't already done so,[generate an upload key and keystore](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key).

After you create your upload key and keystore, you need to generate a public certificate from your upload key using[`keytool`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html), with the following command:  

```
$ keytool -export -rfc
  -keystore your-upload-keystore.jks
  -alias upload-alias
  -file output_upload_certificate.pem
```

Now that you have your upload certificate, register it with Google when prompted in the Play Console or[when resetting your upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#reset_upload_key).

#### Upgrade your app signing key

In some circumstances, you might want to change your app's signing key. For example, because you want a cryptographically stronger key or your signing key has been compromised. However, because users can only update your app if the update is signed with the same signing key, it's difficult to change the signing key for an app that's already published.

If you publish your app to Google Play, you can upgrade the signing key for your published app through the Play Console---your new key is used to sign installs and app updates on Android 13 and higher, while your older app signing key is used to sign updates for users on earlier versions of Android.

To learn more, read[Upgrade your app signing key](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423#Upgrade).

### Reset a lost or compromised private upload key

If you lost your private upload key or your private key has been compromised, you can create a new one and[request an upload key reset](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423#reset)in the Play console.
| **Note:** Resetting your upload key will not affect the app signing key that Google Play uses to re-sign APKs before delivering to users.

### Configure the build process to automatically sign your app

In Android Studio, you can configure your project to sign the release version of your app automatically during the build process by creating a signing configuration and assigning it to your release build type. A signing configuration consists of a keystore location, keystore password, key alias, and key password. To create a signing configuration and assign it to your release build type using Android Studio, complete the following steps:

1. In the**Project** window, right click on your app and click**Open Module Settings**.
2. On the**Project Structure** window, under**Modules**in the left panel, click the module you would like to sign.
3. Click the**Signing** tab, then click**Add** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/add-signing-config_2-1_2x.png).
4. Select your keystore file, enter a name for this signing configuration (as you may create more than one), and enter the required information.

   ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/project-structure-signing_2-1_2x.png)

   **Figure 7**. The window for creating a new signing configuration.
5. Click the**Build Types**tab.
6. Click the**release**build.
7. Under**Signing Config**, select the signing configuration you just created.

   ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/project-structure-build-types_2-1_2x.png)

   **Figure 8**. Select a signing configuration in Android Studio.
8. Click**OK**.

Now every time you build your release build type by selecting an option under**Build \> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** in Android Studio, the IDE will sign your app automatically, using the signing configuration you specified. You can find your signed APK or app bundle in the`build/outputs/`directory inside the project directory for the module you are building.

When you create a signing configuration, your signing information is included in plain text in your Gradle build files. If you are working in a team or sharing your code publicly, you should keep your signing information secure by removing it from the build files and storing it separately. You can read more about how to remove your signing information from your build files in[Remove Signing Information from Your Build Files](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#secure-shared-keystore). For more about keeping your signing information secure, see[Keep your key secure](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#secure_key), below.

### Sign each product flavor differently

If your app uses product flavors and you would like to sign each flavor differently, you can create additional signing configurations and assign them by flavor:

1. In the**Project** window, right click on your app and click**Open Module Settings**.
2. On the**Project Structure** window, under**Modules**in the left panel, click the module you would like to sign.
3. Click the**Signing** tab, then click**Add** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/add-signing-config_2-1_2x.png).
4. Select your keystore file, enter a name for this signing configuration (as you may create more than one), and enter the required information.

   ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/project-structure-signing_2-1_2x.png)

   **Figure 10**. The window for creating a new signing configuration.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary until you have created all your signing configurations.
6. Click the**Flavors**tab.
7. Click the flavor you would like to configure, then select the appropriate signing configuration from the**Signing Config** dropdown menu.![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/publish/project-structure-flavors_2-1_2x.png)

   **Figure 11**. Configure signing settings by product flavor.

   Repeat to configure any additional product flavors.
8. Click**OK**.

You can also specify your signing settings in Gradle configuration files. For more information, see[Configuring Signing Settings](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#signing).

## Run a signing report

To get signing information for each of your app's variants, run the Gradle`signingReport`task in Android Studio:

1. Select**View \> Tool Windows \> Gradle**to open the Gradle tool window
2. Select**YourApp \> Tasks \> android \> signingReport**to run the report

| **Note:** If you don't see`signingReport`in the list of Gradle tasks, open the Android Studio settings dialog by selecting**File \> Settings** (**Android Studio \> Settings** on macOS), select**Experimental**, then under the Gradle heading, clear any checkboxes that limit the types of tasks included in the Gradle task list.

## Manage your own signing key

If you choose not to opt in to Play App Signing (only for apps created before August 2021), you can manage your own app signing key and keystore. Keep in mind,**you are responsible for securing the key and the keystore**. Additionally, your app will not be able to support Android App Bundles, Play Feature Delivery and Play Asset Delivery.

When you are ready to create your own key and keystore, make sure you first choose a strong password for your keystore and a separate strong password for each private key stored in the keystore. You must keep your keystore in a safe and secure place. If you lose access to your app signing key or your key is compromised, Google cannot retrieve the app signing key for you, and you will not be able to release new versions of your app to users as updates to the original app. For more information, see[Keep your key secure](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#secure_key), below.

If you manage your own app signing key and keystore, when you sign your APK, you will sign it locally using your app signing key and upload the signed APK directly to the Google Play Store for distribution as shown in figure 12.

When you use[Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#google-play-app-signing), Google keeps your signing key safe, and ensures your apps are correctly signed and able to receive updates throughout their lifespans. However, if you decide to manage your app signing key yourself, there are a few considerations you should keep in mind.

## Signing considerations

You should sign your app with the same certificate throughout its expected lifespan. There are several reasons why you should do so:

- **App upgrade:**When the system is installing an update to an app, it compares the certificate(s) in the new version with those in the existing version. The system allows the update if the certificates match. If you sign the new version with a different certificate, you must assign a different package name to the app---in this case, the user installs the new version as a completely new app.
- **App modularity:**Android allows APKs signed by the same certificate to run in the same process, if the apps so request, so that the system treats them as a single app. In this way you can deploy your app in modules, and users can update each of the modules independently.
- **Code/data sharing through permissions:**Android provides signature-based permissions enforcement, so that an app can expose functionality to another app that is signed with a specified certificate. By signing multiple APKs with the same certificate and using signature-based permissions checks, your apps can share code and data in a secure manner.

If you plan to support upgrades for an app, ensure that your app signing key has a validity period that exceeds the expected lifespan of that app. A validity period of 25 years or more is recommended. When your key's validity period expires, users will no longer be able to seamlessly upgrade to new versions of your app.

If you plan to publish your apps on Google Play, the key you use to sign your app must have a validity period ending after 22 October 2033. Google Play enforces this requirement to ensure that users can seamlessly upgrade apps when new versions are available.

### Keep your key secure

If you choose to manage and secure your app signing key and keystore yourself (instead of opting in to[Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#app-signing-google-play)), securing your app signing key is of critical importance, both to you and to the user. If you allow someone to use your key, or if you leave your keystore and passwords in an unsecured location such that a third-party could find and use them, your authoring identity and the trust of the user are compromised.
| **Note:** If you use Play App Signing, your app signing key is kept secure using Google's infrastructure. You should still keep your upload key secure as described below. If your upload key is compromised, you can[request an upload key reset](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#reset_upload_key)in the Play Console.

If a third party should manage to take your app signing key without your knowledge or permission, that person could sign and distribute apps that maliciously replace your authentic apps or corrupt them. Such a person could also sign and distribute apps under your identity that attack other apps or the system itself, or corrupt or steal user data.

Your private key is required for signing all future versions of your app. If you lose or misplace your key, you will not be able to publish updates to your existing app. You cannot regenerate a previously generated key.

Your reputation as a developer entity depends on your securing your app signing key properly, at all times, until the key is expired. Here are some tips for keeping your key secure:

- Select strong passwords for the keystore and key.
- Do not give or lend anyone your private key, and do not let unauthorized persons know your keystore and key passwords.
- Keep the keystore file containing your private key in a safe, secure place.

In general, if you follow common-sense precautions when generating, using, and storing your key, it will remain secure.

#### Remove signing information from your build files

When you create a signing configuration, Android Studio adds your signing information in plain text to the module's`build.gradle`files. If you are working with a team or open-sourcing your code, you should move this sensitive information out of the build files so it is not easily accessible to others. To do this, you should create a separate properties file to store secure information and refer to that file in your build files as follows:

1. Create a signing configuration, and assign it to one or more build types. These instructions assume you have configured a single signing configuration for your release build type, as described in[Configure the build process to automatically sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-auto), above.
2. Create a file named`keystore.properties`in the root directory of your project. This file should contain your signing information, as follows:  

   ```
   storePassword=myStorePassword
   keyPassword=mykeyPassword
   keyAlias=myKeyAlias
   storeFile=myStoreFileLocation
   ```
3. In your module's`build.gradle`file, add code to load your`keystore.properties`file before the`android {}`block.  

   ### Groovy

   ```groovy
   ...

   // Create a variable called keystorePropertiesFile, and initialize it to your
   // keystore.properties file, in the rootProject folder.
   def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")

   // Initialize a new Properties() object called keystoreProperties.
   def keystoreProperties = new Properties()

   // Load your keystore.properties file into the keystoreProperties object.
   keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))

   android {
       ...
   }
   ```

   ### Kotlin

   ```kotlin
   ...
   import java.util.Properties
   import java.io.FileInputStream

   // Create a variable called keystorePropertiesFile, and initialize it to your
   // keystore.properties file, in the rootProject folder.
   val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")

   // Initialize a new Properties() object called keystoreProperties.
   val keystoreProperties = Properties()

   // Load your keystore.properties file into the keystoreProperties object.
   keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))

   android {
       ...
   }
   ```

   **Note:** You could choose to store your`keystore.properties`file in another location (for example, in the module folder rather than the root folder for the project, or on your build server if you are using a continuous integration tool). In that case, you should modify the code above to correctly initialize`keystorePropertiesFile`using your actual`keystore.properties`file's location.
4. You can refer to properties stored in`keystoreProperties`using the syntax`keystoreProperties['`<var translate="no">propertyName</var>`']`. Modify the`signingConfigs`block of your module's`build.gradle`file to reference the signing information stored in`keystoreProperties`using this syntax.  

   ### Groovy

   ```groovy
   android {
       signingConfigs {
           config {
               keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
               keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
               storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
               storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
           }
       }
       ...
     }
   ```

   ### Kotlin

   ```kotlin
   android {
       signingConfigs {
           create("config") {
               keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
               keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
               storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
               storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
           }
       }
       ...
     }
   ```
5. Open the**Build Variants**tool window and ensure that the release build type is selected.
6. Select an option under**Build \> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** to build either an APK or app bundle of your release build. You should see the build output in the`build/outputs/`directory for your module.

Because your build files no longer contain sensitive information, you can now include them in source control or upload them to a shared codebase. Be sure to keep the`keystore.properties`file secure. This may include removing it from your source control system.

# Upload your app to the Play Console

After you[sign the release version of your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk), the next step is to upload it to Google Play to inspect, test, and publish your app. Before you get started, you must meet the following requirements:

- If you haven't already done so,[enroll in Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#enroll), which is the mandatory way to upload and sign all new apps since August 2021.

- Ensure that your app meets Google Play's size requirements. Google Play supports a cumulative total download size of 4 GB. This size includes all modules and install-time asset packs. To learn more, read[Google Play maximum size limits](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859372#size_limits).

After you've met the preceding requirements,[upload your app to the Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011).

This page also describes how you can test and update your app bundle after it's been uploaded.

## Inspect APKs using Latest releases and bundles

If you upload your app as an Android App Bundle, the Play Console automatically generates split APKs and multi-APKs for all device configurations your app supports. In the Play Console, you can use the "Latest bundles" section in the "Latest releases and bundles" page to see all APK artifacts that Google Play generates, inspect data such as supported devices and APK size savings, and download generated APKs to deploy and test locally.

To see more details about your app bundle, see the Play Console help topic

[Inspect app versions with Latest releases and bundles](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9006925).

## Test your app internally

There are several ways to share your app internally for testing:

- Upload and distribute your app internally using[Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.com/docs/app-distribution).
- Upload and distribute your app internally using[Play Console's internal app sharing tool](https://play.google.com/console/internal-app-sharing).

Each of these offers slightly different benefits, so use the one that works best for your team.

- Firebase app distribution lets you deploy any kind of build and distribute it to a list of users. This can be a good way of distributing builds from a continuous integration system so that testers can access specific builds for testing.

- Play console internal track is faster to deploy compared to the alpha or beta tracks and gives you access to services such as Subscriptions, In-App purchases, and ads. This also goes through Play Console signing and shrinking so is the closest to what is distributed to end users through the play store. It is possible to defer the Play Store review until later to avoid having to wait for review to complete. However, the review is required before you can fully distribute your app to end-users through the Play Store.

## Update your app bundle

To update your app after you upload it to the Play Console, you need to increase the version code included in the base module, then build and upload a new app bundle. Google Play then generates updated APKs with new version codes and serves them to users as needed.
