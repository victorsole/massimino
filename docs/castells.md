## 2. TRAINING PRINCIPLES FOR CASTELLERS

### Key Training Concepts

1. **Isometric Strength**: Castellers must hold positions for 30-90 seconds under significant load
2. **Core Stiffness**: Ability to maintain spinal stability against external forces
3. **Grip Endurance**: Sustained holding capacity without fatigue
4. **Positional Strength**: Strength in specific angles and body positions
5. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increasing time under tension and load

### Training Frequency
- **2-3 sessions per week** minimum
- Allow 48 hours recovery between intense sessions
- Can be split: 2 gym sessions + 1 bodyweight session

### Session Duration
- **45-90 minutes** per session
- Warm-up: 10-15 minutes
- Main work: 30-60 minutes
- Cool-down: 10-15 minutes

## 4. PERIODIZATION & PROGRAMMING NOTES

### 8-Week Training Block Example

**Weeks 1-2: Adaptation Phase**
- Focus on learning exercises and proper form
- Moderate weights, moderate reps
- 2 sessions per week

**Weeks 3-5: Strength Building Phase**
- Increase weights progressively
- Lower reps (6-10 range for main lifts)
- Add isometric holds
- 2-3 sessions per week

**Weeks 6-7: Peak Strength Phase**
