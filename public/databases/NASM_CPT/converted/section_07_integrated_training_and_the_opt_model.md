# Integrated Training and the OPT Model

[According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary (2019), to integrate means
to "form, coordinate, or blend into a functioning or unified whole." In
the world of food, a common lunch menu item is the chef salad. When we
mix together or form this salad, the ingredients are as follows: lettuce
as the base, hard-boiled eggs, deli ham, deli turkey, tomatoes,
cucumbers, and cheese. This integrated approach to a salad shows that
many ingredients can be included in this dish to provide a flavourful
and enjoyable experience. At any point, this salad can be customized to
the likes of the person who wants to eat it. For example, a patron who
is lactose-intolerant can substitute the cheese with extra eggs or
croutons, or a vegan can substitute more vegetables in replacement of
eggs and deli meat.]{.mark}

[An exercise program can follow a similar strategy. For instance, just
like removing cheese from the chef salad, fitness professionals can opt
out of heavy squatting to accommodate a client who was recently released
from physical therapy due to a knee injury. Instead, the fitness
professional can substitute core and balance drills to make that
training session more tailored to their client's needs and abilities.
When fitness professionals take an integrated approach to exercise,
their programs become well balanced while reducing boredom and can
maximize results.]{.mark}

[Integrated training is a concept that combines all forms of exercise
into one system: flexibility; cardiorespiratory; core; balance;
plyometric; speed, agility, and quickness; and resistance training. It
is an all-inclusive approach to exercise that can lead to improvements
in overall health, wellness, and athletic performance.]{.mark}

[Using integrated training principles, a Certified Personal Trainer will
discover many new and exciting exercises, movements, and other variables
to add to their professional toolbox. As a result, fitness professionals
will be able to create customized exercise programs for their clients
that provide several benefits:]{.mark}

- [Psychological benefits, such as stress relief, improved mood, and
  improved sleep]{.mark}

- [Physiological benefits, such as improved cardiovascular, respiratory,
  and endocrine (hormone) functionality]{.mark}

- [Body composition benefits, such as fat loss and increased lean muscle
  mass]{.mark}

- [Performance benefits, such as increased flexibility, endurance,
  strength, and power.]{.mark}

[A fitness professional can benefit a great deal from implementing
integrated training with their clients because of the variety of
exercises involved. Integrated training programs incorporating different
types of training in a multiplanar fashion are more optimal than
isolated resistance training programs. Areas of improvement were found
in movement quality, speed and agility, strength, endurance,
flexibility, and power. This does not mean that isolated training is
ineffective, but when the fitness professional intends to provide the
greatest changes to their clients, integrated training improves more
variables than isolated training. Research has indicated that a
multidimensional, or integrated, training approach can provide a greater
effectiveness to an exercise program than an isolated resistance
program. This indicates that if the fitness professional implements an
integrated approach, the client can benefit to a higher extent by
incorporating more variables aimed at creating specific results based on
client goals, needs, and abilities.]{.mark}

[However, it is important to note that integrated training principles
involve more than a variety of exercises. Additional principles that
must be observed include training in a systematic and progressive
fashion, training fundamental movement patterns, training with optimal
posture, training for optimal range of motion, training in all planes
and motion, manipulating acute variables (e.g., sets, reps, and rest
periods), and designing exercise programs based on assessment
results.]{.mark}

**Training in a systematic and progressive fashion**

[When a house is built, construction companies must use a systematic and
progressive approach to ensure its solidity and stability, starting with
the foundation. The outcome would be vastly different if a house was
built directly on the ground versus a concrete slab foundation. For
example, the walls and roof may become uneven or unstable, thus reducing
the overall integrity of the house.]{.mark}

[The same is true for exercise. Like a house, the body must also have a
solid foundation of fitness before embarking on an intense training
regimen. It is illogical and potentially dangerous for a fitness
professional to recommend exercises that are too advanced or physically
demanding for their clients. It may also cause frustration and reduce a
client's own self-efficacy. Fitness professionals should guide their
clients to first build a solid foundation that includes appropriate
levels of aerobic and muscular endurance, joint mobility and stability,
and core strength. This is best accomplished by using a systematic and
progressive approach to program design. If an exercise program is
progressive and systematic, using a progressive overload approach, the
body sufficiently adapts to the new demands placed on it and
consequently becomes stronger and more resilient. Conversely, skipping
steps may do more harm than good.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[Goal setting, constant monitoring, and assessing clients at the
appropriate times provide feedback to the fitness professional, so that
they can adjust and deliver a systematic approach to all exercise
sessions. Without completing these tasks, the fitness professional takes
the chance of not getting the appropriate feedback, which is critically
important for making the necessary changes for the client to experience
continuous improvement.]{.mark}

**Training fundamental movement patterns**

[Fundamental movements patterns are a necessity for all fitness
professionals to demonstrate and teach to their clients. Fitness
professionals must ensure their clients' mastery of these movement
patterns to minimize injury risk and increase exercise effectiveness.
Most exercises involve at least one of these movement patterns; though
more movement patterns exist, and many of these patterns can be combined
into a single exercise:]{.mark}

1.  [Squatting]{.mark}

2.  [Hip hinge]{.mark}

3.  [Pulling motions]{.mark}

4.  [Pushing motions]{.mark}

5.  [Vertical pressing]{.mark}

[Categorizing exercises according to movement patterns is an effective
method for assisting fitness professionals when designing exercise
programs. Historically, resistance training programs were developed and
implemented according to isolated body-part training. This is especially
true with regards to bodybuilding and those seeking to alter their body
composition. For example, the individual may choose to train their chest
and triceps on Monday, back and biceps on Tuesday, legs on Wednesday,
and shoulders and arms on Thursday.]{.mark}

[While isolated body-part training is still an effective method for
increasing muscular hypertrophy, designing exercise programs based on
movement patterns may provide enhanced adaptations when compared to
isolated resistance training, such as enhancing neuromuscular
coordination and athleticism. A movement pattern exercise design can
include many variations. For example, the individual may choose pushing
patterns on Monday, pulling patterns on Tuesday, squatting and hip
hinging on Wednesdays, and vertical pressing on Thursdays. There are
almost limitless possibilities.]{.mark}

TRY THIS

[Not only should a fitness professional incorporate diverse movement
patterns into their client's training program, they should also master
these movements for their own benefit. When instructing a client,
fitness professionals must be able to explain, demonstrate, correct, and
cue the individual. This will reduce worry and confusion for the client
and subsequently elevate the fitness professional's status as a true
expert in the field of personal training.]{.mark}

**Training with optimal posture**

[Posture is the relative disposition of the body parts in relation to
the physical position, such as standing, lying down, and sitting.
Generally speaking, posture is the way the body maintains spinal
position in relationship to other body segments. Maintaining ideal
posture places the client's body in the most optimal state to perform
movement patterns safely and effectively. However, maintaining ideal
posture is a difficult challenge, especially as people age and have
developed compensatory movement patterns and faulty static
postures.]{.mark}

[The aim of the fitness professional is to create progressive and
systematic exercise programs that inherently maintain or correct posture
to reduce injury risk, enhance the client's physical health, and allow
for a more enjoyable exercise experience. If a systematic and
progressive approach is applied, many physical enhancements will occur,
such as increased flexibility, endurance, strength, and power. Improving
posture is another physical enhancement that occurs when using a
systematic approach to program design.]{.mark}

[When programming for optimal posture, the fitness professional will use
appropriate flexibility and strengthening techniques to help correct
muscle imbalances and include unilateral/bilateral and
anterior/posterior exercises to create symmetry between right/left and
front/back sides of the body. Without creating a balanced attack inside
of a systematic program, maintaining or improving posture will be
limited. The recipe for success is an integrated approach to program
design. Flexibility, core, balance, plyometric, and resistance training
exercises are all useful forms of exercise to improve posture.
Cardiorespiratory exercise may also prove beneficial due to changes in
body composition (e.g., reduced body fat) and improvements in muscular
endurance.]{.mark}

**Training for optimal range of motion**

[Like posture, working within an optimal range of motion (ROM) allows
joints to move freely. Clients are often plagued by muscle imbalance,
poor posture, or joint restrictions. As a consequence, ROM at certain
joints can become restricted, which limits movement and may lead to
injury. For example, limitations in hip mobility have been implicated in
hip, spine, and lower extremity dysfunction.]{.mark}

[Conversely, complete ROM means the body is not limited or restricted.
In other words, complete ROM is the ability of a joint to move freely
between the open and closed portion of the joint movement (Keogh et al.,
2019). This also relates to the concentric and eccentric actions of the
muscles that allow the joint to open and close.]{.mark}

[The fitness professional must understand that restrictions of a
particular ROM may occur because a prior injury may have caused scar
tissue to form, which changes the mechanics of the joint. Ultimately,
clients may have to work within specific constraints and use caution to
avoid causing further injury to that area. On the other hand, an
individual who does not have a limited ROM should work through all ROMs
to maximize exercise adaptations. Training for optimal ROM requires
patience by both the client and fitness professional because many
factors come into play when dealing with the appropriate range for every
person.]{.mark}

**Training in all planes of motion**

[Fitness professionals should develop exercise programs to require
movement in all three planes of motion: sagittal, frontal, and
transverse. A common mistake made in the fitness industry is to develop
exercise programs that overly emphasize the sagittal plane of motion
(front-to-back motions) and neglect exercises in the frontal
(side-to-side motions) and transverse planes (rotational motions). The
advantage to the body working in all three planes of motion is the
enhancement of muscle recruitment. For example, the posterior fibres of
the gluteus medius concentrically perform hip abduction and hip external
rotation. As such, to effectively target all muscle fibers of the
gluteus medius, the client must perform a variety of movements at the
hips (abduction, external rotation). In other words, simply performing
common hip extension exercises (e.g., squats, lunges) does not
effectively target the gluteus medius muscles.]{.mark}

[In addition, many injuries occur in the frontal and transverse planes
of motion. Unfortunately, when a client does not train in all three
planes of motion, the fitness professional is limiting that client's
body to move efficiently, thereby diminishing ideal movement and
athleticism. Therefore, selection of a variety of exercises in all
planes of motion is a critical component of a client's training
program.]{.mark}

### Acute variables of training

[Acute variables, also known as exercise training variables, determine
the amount of stress placed on the body and ultimately the physical
adaptations that occur, such as increased strength, endurance, weight
loss, or muscle gain. Acute variables can be viewed as all the building
blocks that are used to design an exercise program, which include
repetitions, sets, training intensity, repetition tempo, rest intervals,
training volume, training frequency, training duration, exercise
selection, and exercise order.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[A repetition is one complete movement of an exercise. A set is a group
of consecutive repetitions. Training intensity is an individual's level
of effort compared with their maximal effort, which is usually expressed
as a percentage. A rest interval is the time interval that is given
between each set. Training volume is the sum of the repetitions
performed in a given set during each training session multiplied by the
resistance used.]{.mark}

[Acute variables are the most fundamental components of an integrated
training program because they determine the amount of stress placed on
the body during an exercise session. Properly manipulating acute
variables will help the fitness professional elicit optimal performance
from their clients while reducing the risk of injury.]{.mark}

**Training based on assessment results**

[Programming efforts should focus on the assessments conducted by the
fitness professional prior to their client's initial workout.
Appropriately conducted assessments are needed to develop a baseline
value for different exercises that will be completed in the exercise
program. Also, the detection of muscle imbalances, postural
abnormalities, and other health concerns can reveal necessary
information about a potential client. The fitness professional can then
gain an accurate portrayal of the client to develop the proper movement
patterns for the new exercise program.]{.mark}

[Although this seems easy, gathering data from a fitness assessment and
then accurately using that data to design exercise programs can be a
difficult task.]{.mark}

[However, this process separates generic physical activity from
systematic and progressive exercise programs, which is important because
a lack of assessment can lead to ineffective exercise selection and
programming strategies by the Certified Personal Trainer. From this
baseline starting point and constant improvement from a progressive and
systematic program, fitness professionals can schedule reassessments and
further their understanding of the direction in which the clients are
heading.]{.mark}

**Introduction to integrated training concepts**

[Recall that integrated training combines many forms of exercises into
one program. Clients may be familiar with these forms of exercise, but
not necessarily when used in a systematic fashion. However, integrated
training can have a profound impact on a client's health, fitness, and
athletic performance. This approach is ever changing and provides a
systematic and progressive framework, but only if the training is
implemented correctly. The next few sections will provide a brief
overview of specific components of integrated training.]{.mark}

**Flexibility training**

[Flexibility training increases joint ROM. In other words, flexibility
training involves different types of stretching techniques to improve
tissue extensibility, which allows the body to move freely without being
hindered.]{.mark}

[We recommend using a variety of stretching options in a systematic
fashion to elicit optimal results. These stretching techniques include
self-myofascial techniques, such as foam rolling, static stretching,
active stretching, and dynamic stretching.]{.mark}

**Cardiorespiratory training**

[The number one cause of death around the world is heart disease. To
combat this issue, cardiorespiratory training is a cornerstone of
improvement for heart and lung functionality. Cardiorespiratory training
refers to the capacity of respiratory and cardiovascular systems to
provide muscles with oxygen during sustained and/or intense exercise.
Typical forms of cardiorespiratory exercise include walking, jogging,
running, cycling, biking, swimming, rowing, and sports competition. In
most cases, cardiorespiratory training is a critical component of an
integrated training program. However, the mode, duration, and intensity
of cardiorespiratory exercise will be dependent on the client's health,
wellness, and performance goals.]{.mark}

| [Improved blood flow back to the heart via veins]{.mark}         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Core training**

[The core musculature includes those of the trunk and pelvis that are
responsible for spinal and pelvic stability. These muscles also generate
or transfer energy from the core to the extremities. Core stability is
the ability to control the position and motion of the trunk over the
pelvis and legs for optimal production, transfer, and control of force
and motion. Exercises aimed at enhancing functionality of the core
musculature and core stability are considered part of core
training.]{.mark}

[Core training is sometimes misconstrued and only associated with the
anterior abdominal region of the body, such as the rectus abdominis
(i.e., six-pack muscle). In other words, individuals may believe
crunches and sit-ups are lone core exercises. Fortunately, many
movements can be completed using a variety of exercises that work all
three different planes of motion as well as many muscle groups,
including the obliques, low-back, and gluteal complex.]{.mark}

| racket or golf club)]{.mark}                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Balance training**

[Balance is the ability of a person to maintain, achieve, or restore a
specific state of balance without falling. Balance training is a method
that can create better movement patterns for all clients and reduce the
occurrence of falls in the elderly and ankle sprains for athletes.
Balance training is used for improving postural control by challenging
the alignment of the body's centre of gravity with regard to the base of
support.]{.mark}

[The more control the body is able to maintain, the more opportunities
abound to incorporate more challenging movements into most exercise
sessions. This holds true for any age of a client, and while it does
benefit the elderly immensely, it should not be diminished in those who
are considered younger.]{.mark}

[Balance training can be very beneficial for the general population,
experienced exercisers, and even highly skilled athletes.]{.mark}

+------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Plyometric (reactive) training**

[Plyometric training is also known as reactive or jump training. A
fallacy exists that plyometric exercises are only appropriate for
athletes. However, plyometric training can be a safe and effective mode
of exercise for many populations, since it is a form of exercise
characterized by the expression of muscular power. Yet, variations of
plyometric training exist to accommodate clients of differing skill and
fitness levels.]{.mark}

[Plyometric training does not require many exercises or a high amount of
volume, especially if it is completed prior to a resistance training
session. In addition, a plyometric training session may be completed on
different days in which the volume and amount of exercises can be
increased for a greater stimulus. Plyometric exercise improves the
stretch-shortening cycle, which enhances a client's ability to move
explosively.]{.mark}

**Speed, Agility, and Quickness training**

[Speed, agility, and quickness (SAQ) training is another form of
exercise that can be misconstrued as something fit just for athletic
purposes. Like plyometrics, these drills can all be modified to be
beneficial for most types of clients.]{.mark}

[SAQ training is a system of progressive exercises and instruction aimed
at developing fundamental motor abilities to enhance the capability of
individuals to be more skilful at faster speeds and with greater
precision. The movement patterns used can also be of great assistance in
preventing falls and increasing agility, reaction time, sprinting
velocity, and lower-body power.]{.mark}

[SAQ training is similar to explosive jump, or plyometric training, but
the idea is to propel the body as quickly as possible, to accelerate and
decelerate as fast as possible, or to change directions with ease and
speed changes. Like plyometrics, SAQ exercises can be completed as their
own workout or combined into an integrated training session.]{.mark}

**Resistance training**

[Resistance training can promote marked increases in muscle strength and
hypertrophy, with improvements in these outcome measures seen
irrespective of age and gender. In addition, resistance training has
shown to be an effective mode of exercise to improve bone density and
muscular strength and enhance cardiovascular health. Moreover,
resistance training plays a fundamental role in improving athletic
performance and rehabilitation from musculoskeletal injury. Lastly,
resistance exercise is an effective method for increasing lean body mass
and reducing body fat, especially when it is combined with proper
dietary measures.]{.mark}

[The role of resistance training in an integrated training program
cannot be overemphasized, and fitness professionals must be well-versed
in its benefits. In addition, fitness professionals must be skilled at
designing and implementing resistance training protocols for a variety
of clients, including youths, athletes, elderly, pre- and postnatal
parents, and weight-loss clients.]{.mark}

### The Optimum Performance Training Model

[Exercise training programs are largely based on the past experiences of
those designing them. For example, training programs designed by those
with backgrounds in bodybuilding, powerlifting, or Olympic weightlifting
tend to vary considerably from programs designed by those with
experience in endurance training or group exercise, such as aerobics,
dance, or Pilates. Although experience is always an important quality to
have in any field, including personal training, it is not the only
qualification; in some cases, it is not even the most important
qualification held by a Certified Personal Trainer. Designing safe and
effective exercise training programs requires a variety of skills,
including knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and human movement; the
ability to communicate effectively with clients; and experience in
working with diverse populations.]{.mark}

[To help Certified Personal Trainers design safe and effective training
programs based on the client's individual needs, We recommend using a
structured, scientifically based program design model. The training
program should be a methodical approach to improve physical and
performance adaptations. The best way to achieve consistent, superior
results is to follow a structured, periodized training program. Evidence
also exists that an integrated program that includes flexibility; core;
balance; plyometric; speed, agility, and quickness; resistance; and
cardiorespiratory training can decrease injury and improve
performance.]{.mark}

[As such, NASM created an evidenced-based training system known as the
Optimum Performance Training (OPT) model. The OPT model was
conceptualized as a training program for a society that has more
structural imbalances and susceptibility to injury than ever before. It
is a process of programming that systematically progresses any client to
any fitness or sport-performance goal.]{.mark}

[The OPT model is divided into three different levels of
training---stabilization, strength, and power, which are subdivided into
five phases. It is imperative that fitness professionals understand the
scientific rationale behind each level and each individual phase of
training so they can properly use the OPT model.]{.mark}

**Stabilization**

[The first level of training in the OPT model focuses on two main
adaptations: improving movement patterns and enhancing stabilization. By
doing so, it prepares the body for the demands of higher levels of
training that may follow. This period is crucial for all beginners. It
is also necessary to cycle back through this level after periods of
strength and power training to maintain a high degree of core and joint
stability. In addition, it allows the body to actively rest from more
intense bouts of training. The focus of stabilization training includes
the following goals:]{.mark}

- [Improving movement patterns and exercise technique]{.mark}

- [Improving muscle imbalances]{.mark}

- [Improving joint ROM and flexibility]{.mark}

- [Improving stabilization of the core musculature and peripheral
  joints]{.mark}

- [Preventing tissue overload by preparing muscles, tendons, ligaments,
  and joints for the upcoming imposed demands of training]{.mark}

- [Improving overall cardiorespiratory conditioning]{.mark}

[The stabilization level of training in the OPT model consists of one
phase of training: Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training.]{.mark}

[Phase 1 stabilization endurance training]{.underline}

[Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training is designed to teach optimal
movement patterns (e.g., pushing, pulling, pressing, squatting, hip
hinging) and to help clients become familiar with various modes of
exercise. In addition, this phase of training creates optimal levels of
joint and core stabilization and postural control. Although this phase
is the first phase of training in the OPT model, it will also be
important to cycle back through this phase of training between periods
of higher-intensity training seen in Phases 2 through 5. This will
ensure proper recovery while maintaining high levels of
stability.]{.mark}

[Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training focuses on exercises and
movements that enhance muscular endurance, joint ROM, joint and core
stability, and muscular coordination. It requires slow and controlled
movements, relatively light loads, and meticulous attention to proper
posture and exercise technique.]{.mark}

[In the early implementation of this phase, fitness professionals should
focus a great deal of energy on honing and perfecting proper movement
patterns and introducing clients to a variety of exercise modalities.
The goal is to improve the client's ability to move in a biomechanically
correct manner to reduce the risk of injury, which may have the added
benefit of increasing client adherence to the exercise program. Clients
are more likely to stick with an exercise program if they feel confident
in their abilities.]{.mark}

[Once movement patterns have been addressed, exercises can be progressed
by introducing a greater challenge to the balance and stabilization
systems of the body versus simply increasing the load. For example, a
client may begin by performing a push-up and then progress by performing
the same exercise using a stability ball. This progression requires
additional activation from the nervous system and the stabilizing
muscles of the shoulders and trunk to maintain optimal posture while
performing the exercise.]{.mark}

[Phase 1 Stabilization Endurance Training not only addresses the
existing structural deficiencies, it may also provide a superior way to
alter body composition (reduce body fat) because all the exercises can
be performed in a circuit fashion, using short rest periods along with a
high number of repetitions. By performing exercises in a controlled yet
unstable environment, the body is forced to recruit more muscles to
stabilize itself. In doing so, more calories are potentially expended,
especially when performed in succession with minimal rest.]{.mark}

**Strength**

[The emphasis of the strength level of training in the OPT model is to
maintain stabilization endurance while increasing overall muscular
strength. This is also the level of training to which an individual will
progress if their goals are hypertrophy (increasing muscle size) or
maximal strength (lifting heavy loads). The strength level in the OPT
model consists of three phases: Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training,
Phase 3 Muscular Development Training, and Phase 4 Maximal Strength
Training.]{.mark}

[Phase 2 strength endurance training]{.underline}

[In Phase 2 Strength Endurance Training, the goal is to enhance
stabilization endurance while increasing prime mover strength. These two
adaptations are accomplished by performing two exercises in a superset
sequence, back-to-back without rest, with similar joint dynamics. The
first exercise is a traditional strength exercise performed in a stable
environment (such as a bench press), whereas the second exercise is a
stabilization-focused exercise performed in a less stable (yet
controllable) environment (such as a stability ball push-up). The
principle behind this method is to predominantly work the prime movers
in the first exercise to elicit prime mover strength. This is
immediately followed with an exercise that challenges stability and
postural control. This produces an increase in muscular endurance, joint
stability, and ideal posture.]{.mark}

[Phase 3 muscular development training]{.underline}

[Phase 3 Muscular Development Training is designed for individuals who
have the goal of maximal muscle growth (such as bodybuilders). This
phase of training can use a variety of resistance training exercises and
methods to elicit a maximal response in muscle growth. This form of
training can also benefit those seeking to lose body fat while
maintaining lean muscle mass. Because the goal of this phase of training
is primarily muscular hypertrophy, the fitness professional will want to
increase the volume (lots of sets) and intensity (using moderate to
heavy weight) of the program. This phase is optional depending on the
goals of the client, because some clients do not wish to achieve high
levels of muscular growth, such as endurance athletes. However, this
phase is very popular among fitness enthusiasts seeking to reduce body
fat and improve muscle tone.]{.mark}

[Phase 4 maximal strength training]{.underline}

[Phase 4 Maximal Strength Training works toward the goal of maximal
prime mover strength by lifting heavy loads. In other words, in this
phase of training the client will opt for exclusively heavy weights when
performing resistance training exercises. This phase of training is
common for strength athletes, such as those who compete in powerlifting
or strongman competitions and others who require maximal strength (i.e.,
shot-putters, rugby athletes, American football linemen).]{.mark}

[Because the goal is to increase maximal strength capabilities,
individuals must be accustomed to resistance training. This is an
advanced form of exercise that is optional, depending on the goals of
the client.]{.mark}

**Power**

[The power level of training should only be entered after successful
completion of the stabilization and strength levels---unless the client
is well-conditioned, exhibits adequate joint and core stability, and is
familiar with power forms of exercise. This level of training emphasizes
the development of speed and power. This is achieved through one phase
of training simply named Phase 5 Power Training.]{.mark}

[Phase 5 power training]{.underline}

[The goal of Phase 5 Power Training is to increase maximal strength and
rate of force production. This phase of training is important for
improving velocity of movement and athleticism. The premise behind this
phase of training is the execution of a traditional strength exercise
(with a heavy load) superset with a power-focused (high-velocity)
exercise of similar joint dynamics. This form of training, also known as
complex training, has been shown to improve sprint and vertical jump
performance.]{.mark}
