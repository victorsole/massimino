### Plyometric training

[Plyometric training, also known as jump or reactive training, is a form
of exercise that uses explosive movements, such as bounding, jumping, or
forceful upper body movements, to develop muscular power. Employing
plyometric training develops efficient control and production of ground
reaction forces, which can be used to project the body with greater
velocity or speed of movement. The term *reactive training* refers to
the reaction stimulus clients encounter during plyometric training,
which is the ground surface in this case.]{.mark}

[It is important for the fitness professional to understand that
individual clients must possess adequate core strength, joint stability,
and range of motion and have the ability to balance efficiently prior to
performing explosive plyometric exercises. Plyometric training may not
be an appropriate form of training for individuals with select chronic
diseases or other functional limitations. However, the practice of
plyometric training is very important considering the numerous injuries
that occur as a result of an individual's inability to control
decelerative force and that it is often used in latter stages of
physical rehabilitation.]{.mark}

**What Is plyometric training?**

[The ability to generate force as quickly as possible is known as rate
of force production. Success in everyday activities and sport depends on
the speed at which muscular force is generated. Research demonstrates
that resistance training combined with plyometric exercises
significantly increase muscle force production, facilitating increases
in strength and power.]{.mark}

[Plyometric training involves exercises that generate quick, powerful
movements involving an explosive concentric muscle contraction preceded
by an eccentric muscle action. In other words, there is a "cocking" or
loading phase described as an eccentric muscle action that dampens or
slows the downward movement of the body (deceleration) followed
immediately by an explosive concentric muscle contraction]{.mark}

[These types of explosive muscular contractions can be seen in practical
instances, such as rebounding a basketball. Trained basketball players
prepare to jump up for a loose ball by lowering their body slightly by
flexing at the ankles, knees, and hips; this is eccentric loading.
Players may even drop their arms to assist in take-off. At a fairly
shallow point, players will reverse this downward motion and rapidly
project themselves up from the ground extending their ankles, knees,
hips, and arms upward, which is the concentric contraction. The overall
height of their jump is determined by their vertical velocity, or how
fast they leave the ground.]{.mark}

[This is the essence of a plyometric exercise and uses a characteristic
of muscle known as the stretch-shortening cycle. The stretch-shortening
cycle improves the elastic properties of connective tissue and muscle
fibres by enhancing stored elastic energy through the eccentric phase
and releasing it during the concentric phase to increase force
production. In fact, the integrated performance paradigm states that to
move with precision, forces must be eccentrically loaded, isometrically
stabilized, and then unloaded or concentrically accelerated]{.mark}.

**Three phases of plyometric exercise**

[There are three distinct phases of the stretch-shortening cycle
involved in a plyometric exercise: the eccentric or loading phase, the
amortization phase or transition phase, and the concentric or unloading
phase.]{.mark}

[The eccentric phase]{.underline}

[The first phase of a plyometric movement can be classified as the
eccentric phase (deceleration), which describes the preloading or
stretching of the agonist muscle. During the eccentric phase, elastic
energy is stored, and muscle spindles are stimulated, which sends
signals to the central nervous system.]{.mark}

[Potential energy is stored in the elastic components of the muscle
during this loading phase much like stretching a rubber band. This
eccentric phase is predicated on three stretch variables: magnitude of
the stretch, rate of the stretch, and duration of the stretch. Any
manipulation of these key variables can enhance the amount of energy
stored during the eccentric prestretch action.]{.mark}

[The amortization phase]{.underline}

[The next phase is known as the amortization phase, also referred to as
the transition period or phase, which represents the time between the
eccentric phase and the initiation of the concentric contraction
(discussed next). In other words, the amortization phase is the period
of time from which the eccentric phase ends to the time when the
concentric muscle contraction begins. The amortization phase is also
referred to as the electromechanical delay, which describes that space
in time during which the muscle must switch from overcoming force to
imparting force in the intended direction. This phase is critical to
plyometric performance, because the shorter the amortization phase is,
the more effective and powerful the subsequent plyometric movement will
be, as the stored elastic energy is used efficiently in the transition.
If the amortization phase is prolonged, the stored elastic energy is
dissipated as heat, and the stretch reflex is not fully used, which
results in significantly less concentric force output. One of the
primary objectives of plyometric training is to reduce the time in the
amortization phase. Therefore, a rapid switch from an eccentric loading
phase to a concentric contraction leads to a more powerful
response.]{.mark}

[The concentric phase]{.underline}

[The final phase is the concentric phase, which represents the body's
response to the events that occurred during the eccentric and
amortization phases. The concentric phase uses the stored elastic energy
from the eccentric phase to either enhance muscle force production or
dissipate the energy as heat. For example, during a half movement in a
basketball jump shot, as soon as the upward movement begins, the
concentric phase has initiated, and the amortization phase has ended.
Together, the stretch-shortening cycle describes an eccentric phase in
which the muscle is stretched, followed by an amortization phase where
the muscle is in a stabilizing, isometric transitional period, which
leads to a concentric phase that uses the stored energy in the muscle to
deliver an explosive action.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[To better understand the stretch-shortening cycle, imagine holding a
rubber band. To shoot that rubber band, the first step is to stretch it.
Stretching the rubber band creates stored elastic energy that is waiting
to be released. The next step is to release the rubber band, which uses
the stored elastic energy to propel the rubber band through the
air.]{.mark}

[Human muscles work in a similar fashion. To jump upwards with maximal
velocity, the first action is to quickly perform a shallow squat---an
eccentric action. Performing the shallow squat stretches the gluteal
complex, quadriceps, and calves. Consequently, these muscles are now
storing elastic energy that is waiting to be released. Now, with the
stored elastic energy, the jump will be more forceful---a concentric
contraction.]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

**Importance of plyometric training**

[Plyometric exercises increase rate of force production (power) and
motor unit recruitment. These training exercises are a progression that
can be incorporated once a client has achieved an overall strength base,
proper core stability, and balance capabilities. Adequate isometric
stabilization strength that is developed through core, balance, and
resistance exercises decreases the time between the eccentric muscle
action and concentric contraction, resulting in shorter ground contact
times. This may result in a decrease of both tissue overload and
potential injury when performing plyometric training.]{.mark}

[Many movement patterns that occur during functional activities involve
a series of repetitive stretch-shortening cycles. Stretch-shortening
cycles require the neuromuscular system to react quickly and efficiently
after an eccentric muscle action to produce a concentric contraction and
impart the necessary force (or acceleration) in the appropriate
direction. Therefore, improving functional movements, such as cutting or
change of direction, may require exercise routines that emphasize
plyometric training.]{.mark}

[Plyometric training provides the ability to train specific movement
patterns in a biomechanically correct manner at a more functionally
appropriate speed. This provides strengthening of the muscles and
connective tissue to meet the demands of everyday activities and sport.
The ultimate goal of plyometric training is to maximize function as
described by the integrated performance paradigm. This also results in
increased speed of movement for the individual.]{.mark}

[The speed of muscular exertion is limited by neuromuscular
coordination. Plyometric training improves neuromuscular efficiency and
improves the range of speed set by the central nervous system. Optimal
reactive performance of any activity depends on the speed at which
muscular forces can be generated.]{.mark}

[Plyometric training is often perceived by many to be too dangerous,
potentially increasing the risk of injury. However, plyometric training
has a systematic progression sequence that allows a client to begin with
less demanding exercises and progress to more demanding exercises as
they adapt.]{.mark}

[This is no different than any other form of training. If exercises that
are too advanced for the client are assigned to their exercise plan,
they will not have the ability to perform them correctly and they will
compensate. This may lead to faulty movement patterns and increased risk
of injury. When placed within a well-designed programming scheme with
proper progressions, plyometric training can be a vital component to
achieving optimal performance of any activity at any level of
ability.]{.mark}

[For example, a 65-year-old woman and a 25-year-old male professional
athlete may not both need to train for maximal strength. However, they
do need stabilization, strength, and endurance as well as the ability to
produce force quickly to perform daily activities efficiently.
Therefore, it is imperative that both can react and produce sufficient
force: for the 65-year-woman to avoid a fall or for the 25-year-old
athlete to avoid an opponent. Plyometric exercises are performed with a
faster tempo, similar to movements seen in daily life or sport-related
activities.]{.mark}

[Key Takeaways]{.mark}

  athletes.]{.mark}

  sarcopenia.]{.mark}

  function.]{.mark}

**Guidelines for plyometric training**

[Plyometric exercises can be an important component of an exercise or
sports performance training program to enhance an individual's movement
quality, landing mechanics, and power development. However, plyometric
training exercises must be implemented in a systematic and progressive
fashion to ensure safety and minimize the chances of injury.]{.mark}

[A thorough analysis of a client's training history, age, and injury
history may help distinguish clients who may or may not be prepared for
plyometric training.]{.mark}

[Assessing movement quality using movement assessments is also a useful
screening tool. To enhance performance while reducing the likelihood of
injury, clients must recognize the importance of quality and proper
plyometric technique while acquiring adequate base levels of strength
and motor control. While all exercise includes some risk, the explosive
actions of plyometrics suggest that Certified Personal Trainers should
take a measured and progressive approach when using it with athletes and
clients.]{.mark}

**Designing a plyometric training program**

[A client must exhibit basic levels of total body strength, core
strength, and balance before progressing into plyometric training.
Fitness professionals must follow specific program guidelines, proper
exercise selection criteria, and detailed program variables, such as
intensity, volume, frequency, and progressions. Moreover, plyometric
training should only be performed by individuals wearing supportive
shoes and on a proper training surface, such as a grass field,
basketball court, or tartan track. The training surface can have a
profound effect on exercise performance when performing plyometric
drills.]{.mark}

[When designing effective plyometric programs, it is helpful to remember
many key concepts. First, plyometric exercises should progress from
simple, to intermediate, to advanced movements and from low intensity to
medium intensity to high intensity. As a general rule, clients should
practice plyometric skills comprising dual-foot drills before
progressing to single-foot drills.]{.mark}

[Intensity]{.underline}

[Plyometric intensity describes the distance covered and the amount of
effort or stress applied by the muscles, connective tissue, and joints
during plyometric drills. Intensity should be programmed based on the
client's ability to execute the exercise while maintaining adequate
training technique. If technique is lost, the intensity should be
lowered until proper technique is achieved. It is always better to start
off conservatively, because the fitness professional can always increase
the intensity of the exercises once the client masters the movement
pattern. Moreover, it is important for clients to feel confident and
display adequate movement competency during their exercise routine. If
exercises are too difficult, clients may express feelings of shame, and
consequently, their adherence to the exercise program may become
compromised.]{.mark}

[Volume]{.underline}

[Plyometric volume is expressed as the number of foot contacts, throws,
or catches. An example would be the completion of three sets of five
squat jumps, equating to a volume of 15 total squat jumps (3 × 5). The
volume in plyometric training is determined by the choice of exercise
and intensity of movement. As with other forms of exercise training, an
increase in intensity is often paired with a decrease in training
volume.]{.mark}

[Training frequency and recovery]{.underline}

[Training frequency is determined by the client's fitness level, current
training program, training history, injury history, and training goals.
A general recommendation is to allow at least 1 day between intense
plyometric training sessions. At least 48 to 72 hours between sessions
is the recommended guideline when implementing plyometrics for novice
individuals. Research suggests that recovery between workouts must be
sufficient to prevent overtraining and injury. Most apparently healthy
clients will be able to perform one to three plyometric training
sessions per week.]{.mark}

[Essentially, the higher intensity the drill, the more rest is needed
between sets. By not providing a sufficient recovery period between
sets, adequate recovery may not occur and thus will negate potential
benefits. As a general rule, recovery times of 60 to 120 seconds between
drills should be sufficient for full recovery, but this is strictly
determined by the client's fitness level.]{.mark}

**Plyometric training progressions**

[When introducing plyometric exercises, especially to new or beginner
clients, the movements should initially involve small jumps (lower
amplitude) to best learn the movement pattern. They are designed to
establish optimal landing mechanics, postural alignment, and eccentric
strength (ability to decelerate). When an individual lands during these
exercises, they should hold the landing position (or stabilize) for 3--5
seconds. During this time, individuals should make any adjustments
necessary to correct faulty postures before performing the next jump.
Example exercises using this protocol include (but are not limited to)
the following:]{.mark}

- [Squat jump with stabilization]{.mark}

- [Box jump-up with stabilization]{.mark}

- [Box jump-down with stabilization]{.mark}

- [Multiplanar jump with stabilization.]{.mark}

[The next progression involves jumps with more amplitude and dynamic
motion. The speed of the jumps is also progressed. These exercises are
intended to improve dynamic joint stabilization, eccentric strength,
rate of force production, and coordination of the entire human body.
These exercises are performed in a repetitive fashion, spending a
relatively short amount of time on the ground before repeating the
drill. In other words, the client will no longer hold the landing
position for 3--5 seconds but instead initiate another jump upon landing
using a moderate (repeating) tempo. Some example exercises using this
protocol include (but are not limited to) the following:]{.mark}

- [Squat jump]{.mark}

- [Tuck jump]{.mark}

- [Butt kick]{.mark}

- [Power step-up.]{.mark}

[The last progression includes exercises that involve explosive,
powerful movements. These exercises are designed to further improve rate
of force production, eccentric strength, and reactive joint
stabilization. These exercises are performed as fast and as explosively
as possible. Some example exercises using this protocol include (but are
not limited to) the following:]{.mark}

- [Ice skaters (also known as skater jumps)]{.mark}

- [Single-leg power step-up]{.mark}

- [Proprioceptive plyometrics]{.mark}

- [Depth jump.]{.mark}

**Plyometric Exercises**

[Squat Jump with Stabilization]{.underline}

[Make sure the knees always stay in line with the toes, both before
jumping and on landing. Do not allow feet to excessively turn outward or
knees to cave inward.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Box Jump-Up with Stabilization []{.mark}]{.underline}

[Select a box height that is consistent with the physical capabilities
of the client performing the exercise.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Box Jump-Down with Stabilization]{.underline}

[Make sure the client steps off and drops from the prescribed height
when initially attempting this exercise. Jumping from the box presents
different variables and levels of load or intensity of the exercise and
can be used as a progression. Make sure the client lands softly and
quietly on the ground to ensure proper force transmission through the
tissues of the body. Do not let the client land with legs
straight.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Jump with Stabilization]{.underline}

[Injuries often occur when rotating or moving laterally, which is why it
is important for clients to learn how to accelerate, decelerate, and
stabilize in all planes of motion.]{.mark}

[Squat Jump]{.underline}

[]{.mark}

[Make sure to land with the ankles, knees, and hips flexed and pointed
straight ahead, which becomes the takeoff position as well. This will
ensure optimal joint mechanics and muscle recruitment. Perform the
exercise with a repetitive (medium) tempo.]{.mark}

[Lunge Jump]{.underline}

[Make sure to keep the front foot pointed straight ahead during takeoff
and landing. Do not allow the front foot to externally or internally
rotate. Also, keep the front knee pointed straight. Do not allow the
front knee to cave inward during the landing, as this can cause stress
to the connective tissue within the knee.]{.mark}

[Tuck Jump]{.underline}

[Now that the exercises are becoming more dynamic, proper alignment and
landing mechanics will be even more important to maximize force
production and prevent injury.]{.mark}

[Butt Kick]{.underline}

[It is important that the client has ample amounts of flexibility of the
quadriceps to ensure proper execution. Tight quadriceps may cause a
client to arch their lower back when bringing their heels toward the
gluteal muscles.]{.mark}

[Repeat Box Jumps]{.underline}

[Choose a box height that is appropriate for your client. Tripping on
the box is a potential hazard.]{.mark}

[Power Step-Up]{.underline}

[Make sure the knees always stay in line with the toes throughout the
jumping phases of takeoff and landing.]{.mark}

[Ice Skaters (aka Skater Jumps)]{.underline}

[The client can start by hopping side to side from one foot to the other
as fast as possible and then progress by adding a reach with the
opposite hand to make it more integrated (skating action).]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Power Step-Up]{.underline}

[Clients must be made aware that one foot will land on the box and the
other will continue to the ground so that the legs will be offset during
the landing phase. Therefore, they must be mentally prepared to absorb
the landing in this unique position.]{.mark}

[Proprioceptive Plyometrics]{.underline}

[This exercise can be performed with cones or hurdles to increase the
intensity of the exercise. If cones or hurdles are not available, the
fitness professional can also place tape on the floor in the form of an
X and perform the exercise by jumping in different quadrants.]{.mark}

[Depth Jump]{.underline}

[Land from the box softly with both knees pointed straight ahead before
initiating the jump from the ground. The depth jump is an advanced
plyometric exercise that requires precise technique.]{.mark}

[Plyometric Push-Up]{.underline}

[Avoid this exercise if the client experiences hand or wrist
pain.]{.mark}
