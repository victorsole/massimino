## Flexibility training

[Once fitness assessments are completed and all the information has been
processed, the fitness professional can now design the client's exercise
program. The first step should be designing the client's flexibility
portion of the exercise program. Clients often require some type of
flexibility training, which can be applied to the program's warm-up and
cool-down. This section focuses on foundational concepts of flexibility
and how to apply various flexibility techniques with clients.]{.mark}

**What is flexibility?**

[Flexibility is defined as the normal extensibility (ability to stretch)
of all soft tissues (e.g., contractile and noncontractile) that allow
the complete range of motion (ROM) of a joint. Joint ROM is dictated by
the type of joint (e.g., ball-and-socket versus hinge joint), and the
extensibility of muscles and surrounding soft tissues. An important
characteristic of soft tissue is that it will only achieve efficient
extensibility if optimal bodily control is maintained throughout the
entire joint ROM, which is often termed mobility (flexibility + joint
ROM). Flexibility has a major influence on mobility during dynamic
motion.]{.mark}

[There are various factors that can influence flexibility, which include
but are not limited to the following:]{.mark}

- [Genetics]{.mark}

- [Myofascial (connective) tissue elasticity]{.mark}

- [Composition of tendons or skin surrounding the joint]{.mark}

- [Joint structure]{.mark}

- [Strength of opposing muscle groups]{.mark}

- [Body composition]{.mark}

- [Sex]{.mark}

- [Age]{.mark}

- [Activity level]{.mark}

- [Previous injuries or existing medical issues]{.mark}

- [Repetitive movements.]{.mark}

[Poor flexibility can lead to the development of relative flexibility
(altered movement patterns), which is the process in which the human
movement system (HMS) seeks the path of least resistance during
functional movements. A prime example of relative flexibility is seen in
people who squat with their feet excessively externally rotated because
individuals may have limited ankle ROM that prevents adequate ankle
dorsiflexion to perform a squat with proper mechanics. By widening the
stance and externally rotating the feet, the amount of dorsiflexion
required at the ankle to perform a squatting pattern is decreased. A
second example can be seen when people perform an overhead shoulder
press with excessive lumbar extension (arched low-back). Individuals who
possess limited latissimus dorsi extensibility will have decreased
sagittal-plane shoulder flexion (inability to lift arms directly
overhead), and as a result, they compensate for this lack of shoulder
ROM by extending the lumbar spine to allow them to press the load
completely above their head. Relative flexibility can also prevent the
nervous system from efficiently recruiting the correct muscle patterns
and contractions during the movement.]{.mark}

[Flexibility requires extensibility of all soft tissue along with
acceptable bodily control. Adequate flexibility combined with joint ROM
produces proper mobility of the major bodily regions (e.g., upper and
lower extremities). Flexibility training requires a comprehensive
approach that integrates various techniques to achieve optimal soft
tissue extensibility in all planes of motion. To better understand
flexibility training, a few important concepts must first be reviewed,
including the HMS, muscle imbalances, and neuromuscular
efficiency.]{.mark}

**Human Movement System review**

[The HMS, also known as the kinetic chain, comprises the muscular,
skeletal, and nervous systems. The body's kinetic chain can be further
classified into two regional chains: upper kinetic chain (e.g.,
shoulder, elbow, and wrist and hand) and lower kinetic chain (e.g., hip,
knee, and ankle and foot). When referring to movement, the fitness
professional can classify the body as a complete kinetic chain or the
upper and lower kinetic chains. Optimal alignment and function of each
component of the HMS is the cornerstone of a sound training program. If
one or more segments of the HMS are misaligned and not functioning
properly, predictable patterns of dysfunction develop. These patterns of
dysfunction are referred to as postural distortion patterns, which can
lead to poor posture, improper movement, and possible injury.]{.mark}

[Postural distortion patterns (poor static or dynamic posture) are
represented by a lack of structural integrity, resulting from decreased
functioning of one (or more) components of the HMS. A lack of structural
integrity can result in muscle imbalance, altered force-couple
relationships, and altered osteokinematics and arthrokinematics (all
discussed in the following section). There are several static postural
distortions and poor movement patterns that fitness professionals must
be aware of and should be identified while conducting assessments with
their clients.]{.mark}

**Muscle imbalances**

[Muscle imbalances are alterations in the lengths of muscles surrounding
a joint, in which some are overactive (forcing compensation to occur)
and others may be underactive (allowing for the compensation to occur).
Muscle imbalance can be caused by a variety of mechanisms, which include
but are not limited to the following:]{.mark}

- [Postural distortions]{.mark}

- [Repetitive movement]{.mark}

- [Cumulative trauma]{.mark}

- [Emotional duress]{.mark}

- [Poor training technique]{.mark}

- [Poor bodily control]{.mark}

- [Biased training patterns.]{.mark}

[Muscle imbalances may result in altered reciprocal inhibition,
synergistic dominance, and osteo- and arthrokinematic dysfunction. These
imbalances can negatively affect overall functioning of the HMS and
potentially lead to injury.]{.mark}

[Altered reciprocal inhibition]{.underline}

[Reciprocal inhibition is a naturally occurring phenomenon that allows
movement to take place. Reciprocal inhibition is defined as the
simultaneous contraction of the agonist (prime mover) muscle and the
relaxation of its antagonist. For example, to perform elbow flexion
during a biceps curl, the agonist biceps brachii actively contracts
while the antagonist triceps brachii relaxes to allow the movement to
occur.]{.mark}

[However, altered reciprocal inhibition is an impairment of the HMS, and
fitness professionals should aim to correct this phenomenon. Altered
reciprocal inhibition is caused by an overactive agonist muscle
decreasing the neural drive to its functional antagonist. For example,
an overactive hip flexor complex (e.g., iliopsoas, rectus femoris,
tensor fascia latae) would decrease neural drive to the hip extensor
complex (e.g., gluteus maximus and gluteus medius). In other words, the
overactive muscles on the front of the hip are causing the gluteal
muscles to become underactive. Another example is overactive chest
muscles (e.g., pectoralis major and minor) decreasing neural drive to
mid-back muscles (e.g., rhomboids, mid and lower trapezius). In this
scenario, the overactive chest muscles (which are shoulder protractors)
cause the mid-back muscles (which are shoulder retractors) to become
underactive. Altered reciprocal inhibition changes force-couple
relationships, produces synergistic dominance, and leads to the
development of faulty movement patterns, poor bodily control, and joint
dysfunction.]{.mark}

[Synergistic dominance]{.underline}

[Synergistic dominance is a neuromuscular phenomenon that occurs when
synergists take over function for a weak or inhibited prime mover
(agonist). For example, if the hip flexor complex is overactive, it
leads to altered reciprocal inhibition of the hip extensor complex,
which in turn results in increased force output of the synergists for
hip extension (hamstring complex) to compensate for the weakened hip
extensors. In other words, if the gluteal muscles are underactive and
not able to produce force effectively, other muscles, such as the
hamstrings, are now recruited more than usual to assist in performing
hip extension. The result of synergistic dominance is faulty movement
patterns leading to soft tissue and joint dysfunction and eventual
injury (such as hamstring strains).]{.mark}

[HELPFUL HINT]{.mark}

[Synergistic dominance can be a difficult concept to understand. To
help, imagine a professional basketball team who has a star player named
Michael. Michael is the team's leading scorer and the team's best
defender. His skills are unquestionably better than his teammates. Now,
imagine Michael hurts his ankle and his backup is inserted into the
starting lineup. His backup can do all of the things Michael can (e.g.,
dribble, shoot, defend), but not as well. Consequently, the team is not
as productive and does not play its best basketball. The human body
works in a similar fashion. For example, if overactive hip flexors
decrease neural drive to the hip extensors (gluteal complex), then
synergistic muscles (hamstrings) must "pick up the slack" for the
inhibited glutei. In other words, the hamstrings have been inserted into
the starting lineup to replace the gluteal complex to perform hip
extension movements. Yet, the hamstrings are not as well equipped as the
gluteal complex to perform hip extension during functional
tasks.]{.mark}

[Osteokinematic and arthrokinematic dysfunction]{.underline}

[Osteokinematics describes how the bones and joints are moving through a
ROM. In other words, osteokinematics refers to joint motions we can see,
such as flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, or rotation of body
segments. Arthrokinematics describes the motion at the joint surfaces.
There are three major arthrokinematic joint motions: roll, slide or
glide, and spin.]{.mark}

[Altered joint motion can be caused by altered length-tension
relationships, force-couple relationships, and poor joint surface
motion, which results in poor movement efficiency. To achieve efficient
motion through a joint's ROM (osteokinematic), there must be good motion
at the joint surface (arthrokinematics) and soft tissue flexibility. For
example, a client performs a single-leg squat exercise and demonstrates
an excessive knee valgus (knee moves inward) position during the
eccentric phase of the movement. The client's knee joint is
mispositioned, preventing the joint surface from moving efficiently.
This results in decreased knee joint ROM, excessive biomechanical
stress, potential muscle imbalances, and possible compensations at the
hip or ankle as the client attempts to successfully perform the
movement. Poor form on exercises can be a risk factor for
injury.]{.mark}

[Poor neuromuscular efficiency]{.underline}

[Neuromuscular efficiency is the ability of the nervous system to
recruit the correct muscles to produce force, reduce force, and
dynamically stabilize the body's structure in all three planes of
motion.]{.mark}

[For example, when performing a lat pulldown exercise, the latissimus
dorsi (agonist) must be able to concentrically accelerate shoulder
extension, adduction, and internal rotation, while the rhomboids
(synergists) perform downward rotation of the scapulae (shoulder
blades). At the same time, the rotator cuff musculature (stabilizers)
must dynamically stabilize the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint throughout
the motion. If these muscles collectively do not work efficiently
together (force-couples), compensations may ensue, leading to muscle
imbalances, altered joint motion, and possible injury. To allow for
optimal neuromuscular efficiency, individuals must have proper
flexibility in all three planes of motion. This allows for the freedom
of movement needed to perform everyday activities effectively, such as
bending over to tie shoes or reaching in the top cupboard for
dishes.]{.mark}

[It is important to note that the nervous system is the controlling
factor behind this principle, and specific mechanoreceptors (or sensory
receptors) located in the muscles and tendons--- specifically the muscle
spindles and Golgi tendon organ---help determine muscle balance or
imbalance.]{.mark}

[Muscle spindles]{.underline}

[The muscle spindle is a major sensory organ of the muscle and is
composed of microscopic fibers that lie parallel to the muscle fibre.
When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle records the change in
muscle length and speed (rate) of length change and sends this
information to the central nervous system (CNS). The function of the
muscle spindle is to help prevent the muscle from stretching too far or
too fast. This reaction is called the stretch reflex. Thus, the more
sudden the change in muscle length, the stronger the stretch reflex or
muscle contraction. The muscle spindle helps maintain muscle tone and
protects the body from injury.]{.mark}

[Golgi tendon organs]{.underline}

[The Golgi tendon organ (GTO) is located within the point where the
muscle and the tendon meet (musculotendinous junction). The GTO is
sensitive to changes in muscular tension and the speed (rate) of tension
change. When the GTO activates, it sends information to the CNS, causing
the muscle to relax. Prolonged GTO stimulation provides an inhibitory
action to muscle spindles (located within the same muscle). This
neuromuscular reaction is called autogenic inhibition and occurs when
the neural impulses sensing tension are greater than the impulses
causing muscle contraction. The GTO prevents the muscle from being
placed under excessive stress, which could result in injury.]{.mark}

  stiffness)]{.mark}

  [Neural (inhibition of the central nervous system to help the muscle
  relax)]{.mark}

  [Psycho-physiological (stretch tolerance)]{.mark}

**Scientific principles of flexibility**

[When a muscle is lengthened, there is a cascade of neurological
reactions that occurs that allows the muscle to be stretched. This is
called the lengthening reaction. Also, when the body is moving
dynamically, there is a sequencing of muscles that are active and
inhibited (i.e., as one muscle contracts, its antagonist muscle
relaxes). This sequence is called reciprocal inhibition as discussed
previously. These physiological reactions are important to understand
since they are involved in the different flexibility exercises that are
commonly done with clients.]{.mark}

[The lengthening reaction]{.underline}

[The lengthening reaction is a series of responses that the muscle goes
through when being stretched. Often, this reaction is seen when a muscle
is stretched and held for a specific amount of time. The steps in the
lengthening reaction areas are as follows: (1) The muscle is lengthened
(or stretched), and the muscle spindle senses the muscle's length
change; (2) the stretch reflex is activated causing the muscle to
contract; (3) as the muscle is held at that position for a prolonged
period, the muscle spindle\'s firing frequency decreases resulting in a
relaxation response. The lengthening reaction is often seen with static
stretching because static stretches are typically held long enough to
override the muscle spindle.]{.mark}

[Reciprocal inhibition and stretching]{.underline}

[Reciprocal inhibition is a normal neurological reaction that occurs
with human movement, whereas altered reciprocal inhibition occurs when
an overactive agonist muscle inhibits the antagonist. For stretching,
reciprocal inhibition is often involved in different stretches that
involve movement, such as active and dynamic stretching. The stretches
take advantage of the agonist activation and antagonist inhibition to
enhance flexibility, which will be discussed in more detail in the
active and dynamic stretching sections later in this section.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[The fitness professional should recognize that the neuromuscular system
has several mechanisms to protect muscles from overstretching and
allowing for synchronized muscle contraction among different muscle
groups. The stretch reflex can protect the muscle from being
overstretched. The lengthening reaction allows our muscles to be
lengthened or stretched. Reciprocal inhibition allows our muscles to
work in synchronous patterns to perform a desired motion. The different
types of stretching, such as static, active, and dynamic stretching,
incorporate these reactions.]{.mark}

**Scientific rationale for flexibility training**

[There are two potential factors that support the need to implement
flexibility training: pattern overload and the cumulative injury cycle.
It is not uncommon to have clients who do repetitive tasks at work or
home that lead to poor flexibility and potential injury. The fitness
professional plays a key role in helping correct flexibility deficits
and educate the client about the hazards of pattern overload and the
risk for cumulative injury.]{.mark}

**Pattern overload**

[Muscular imbalances have become common and prevalent in society, which
are often caused by pattern overload. Pattern overload is consistently
repeating the same pattern of motion, such as baseball pitching,
long-distance running, and specific occupations, which with time places
abnormal stresses on the body. There are also gym members who train with
the same routine repetitively, which may lead to pattern overload and
place abnormal stresses on the body. Pattern overload may not
necessarily be directly related to exercise. For example, a loading-dock
employee who has a particularly repetitive occupation lifting and
loading packages all day is prone to pattern overload. Factory, assembly
line, and construction workers who repeat the same movement patterns are
also susceptible to pattern overload. Even sitting for long periods of
time while working on a computer is a repetitive stress.]{.mark}

**Cumulative injury cycle**

[It is essential for the fitness professional to understand that poor
posture and repetitive, overuse movements can create dysfunction within
the connective tissue of the human body. These dysfunctions can
eventually lead to an injury and a repair response by the body termed
the *cumulative injury*.]{.mark}

[Current theory supports the idea that repetitive movements, such as
long periods of poor posture, are believed to lead to tissue trauma and
inflammation. Inflammation in turn activates the body's pain response
that initiates a protective mechanism, increasing muscle tension and
causing muscle spasm. These muscle spasms are not like a calf
cramp.]{.mark}

[Heightened activity of the CNS and tissue mechanoreceptors and
nociceptors (e.g., pain receptors) in the injured area create, in
essence, a type of microspasm or tension. As a result of the microspasm,
adhesions may begin to form within the myofascial tissues. These
adhesions form a weak, inelastic matrix that decreases normal mobility
of the soft tissue. The result is altered length-tension relationships,
altered force-couple relationships, and joint dysfunction. Left
unchecked, these adhesions may begin to form structural changes in the
soft tissue that are evident by Davis's law.]{.mark}

[Davis's law states that soft tissue will model along the lines of. Soft
tissue remodels or rebuilds itself with a collagen matrix that forms in
a random fashion and not in the same direction as the muscle fibres. If
the myofascia is not stimulated by movement, lengthening, and
broadening, these connective tissue fibres may act as a roadblock,
preventing soft tissue mobility. This creates alterations in normal
tissue mobility and causes relative flexibility.]{.mark}

**Flexibility techniques**

[Flexibility training is a key component for all training programs. It
is used for a variety of reasons, including correcting muscle
imbalances, increasing joint ROM, improving the extensibility of the
muscles, and improving neuromuscular. There are many types of
flexibility training, including self-myofascial techniques, static
stretching, active stretching, and dynamic stretching, and all of them
can be integrated into an exercise regimen. The focus of flexibility
training is to enhance tissue extensibility and joint ROM in those
tissues found to be overactive during the assessment process.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[Poor posture, pattern overload, and trauma can create muscle imbalances
within specific muscle groups in which certain muscles become overactive
or underactive. The overactive muscles should undergo some type of
flexibility exercises, whereas the underactive muscles may need to be
strengthened. For example, with an anteriorly rotated pelvis, often
observed in the lower crossed syndrome, overactive hip flexors help
create the anterior pelvic rotation, which subsequently causes
lengthening of the hamstring complex. In this case, the hamstrings do
not need to be stretched because they are already in a stretched
position. Instead, the hip flexors need to be stretched due to their
overactive state.]{.mark}

**Self-myofascial techniques**

[There are many self-myofascial techniques available for fitness
professionals and clients. Perhaps, the most popular is self-myofascial
rolling (SMR) with a foam roller, handheld roller, or massage ball. The
foam roller seems to be the most popular among fitness and medical
professionals, and foam rollers come in many shapes, sizes, and
densities.]{.mark}

[Myofascial rolling focuses on the nervous system and fascial system,
which may produce a mechanical response and a neurophysiological
response that influences tissue relaxation and pain in the local and
surrounding tissues by activating sensory pathways of the CNS.]{.mark}

[For the mechanical effect, the direct roller compression may relax the
local myofascia by increasing local blood flow and reducing myofascial
restriction and adhesions. For the neurophysiological effect, the direct
roller compression may influence tissue relaxation and pain in the local
and surrounding tissues by stimulating local mechanoreceptors and pain
receptors. These receptors send inhibitory signals to the CNS,
triggering a cascade of tissue relaxation and pain blocking responses
that affect the tissues being compressed by the roller.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) often occurs 24 to 72 hours after
strenuous exercise, particularly movements that involve a lot of
eccentric deceleration. DOMS is caused by mild damage to the muscle
cells similar to a grade 1 muscle strain. Signs of DOMS may include
pain, restricted movement, stiffness, reduced muscle force capacity, and
compensation at other joints. Often, the sore muscle group will send
pain signals up to the brain, which are processed and translated into a
specific level of pain or discomfort. Researchers postulate that
myofascial rolling may provide a pain-blocking effect by stimulating
other sensory receptors (e.g., mechanoreceptors), which send their own
signals to the brain. These new signals may create a decreased sensation
of DOMS by overriding the pain signal sent from the pain receptors
involved in the sore muscle.]{.mark}

[Self-myofascial rolling is a flexibility technique that focuses on the
neural system and fascial system in the body (or the fibrous tissue that
surrounds and separates muscle tissue). By applying gentle force to an
adhesion, casually referred to as a knot, the elastic muscle fibres are
altered from a bundled position (which causes the adhesion) into a
straighter alignment with the direction of the muscle or fascia. The
gentle pressure from the implement used, such as a foam roller, will
stimulate the GTO and create autogenic inhibition, decreasing muscle
spindle excitation and releasing the tension of the underlying
musculature. In other words, gentle pressure similar to a massage helps
to release unwanted muscular tension.]{.mark}

[It is crucial to note that when a person is using a foam roller, they
should find a tender spot and sustain pressure on that spot for a
minimum of 30 seconds, which will increase the relaxation response. It
may take longer, depending on the client's ability to consciously relax.
Self-myofascial rolling is suggested before stretching because it may
potentially improve the effectiveness of static stretching techniques.
In addition, self-myofascial rolling can be used during the cool-down
process.]{.mark}

joint. This exercise can be too painful for some individuals. If this
occurs, opt for a handheld roller instead.]{.mark}

[SMR: Tensor Fascia Latae]{.underline}

[The tensor fascia latae (TFL) is a small muscle, so this technique does
not require lots of movement. To target the TFL, roll along the front
and slightly lateral (outside) part of the upper thigh (just below the
pelvis). Avoid rolling over the hip bone.]{.mark}

[SMR: Piriformis]{.underline}

[The piriformis is a small muscle of the posterior hip that runs
horizontally across the pelvis. To target the piriformis, sit on top of
the foam roll, positioned on the back of the hip. Cross one foot to the
opposite knee and lean into the hip of the crossed leg. Roll back and
forth over the muscle. Avoid rolling over the hip bone.]{.mark}

[SMR: Thoracic Spine]{.underline}

[The client keeps the bridge position and rolls along the thoracic
spine. The client can choose to support their head in their hands (as
shown) or cross their arms in front of their chest. This is a good
technique to gain thoracic extension of the spine. Avoid rolling over
the low-back (lumbar spine) and neck (cervical spine).]{.mark}

[SMR: Latissimus Dorsi]{.underline}

[To target the latissimus dorsi, lie on the floor on one side with the
arm closest to the floor outstretched and thumb facing upward. Place the
foam roller under the armpit area (axillary region) and slowly roll
until a tender spot is identified.]{.mark}

**Precautions and contraindications**

[Before programming self-myofascial techniques, fitness professionals
should consider any medical precautions or contraindications. Medical
precautions are any medical conditions that could be unsafe for
flexibility exercise. In the presence of a medical precaution, the
fitness professional may be able to modify an exercise for the client to
be safe. For example, foam rolling for a client with osteopenia (a
precursor to osteoporosis) is considered a precaution due to the risk of
causing bone injury. As a modification, the fitness professional may
choose to teach low-intensity, static stretching of the legs and arms to
the client. The precautions are not all inclusive, as other precautions
may be present with specific clients. Before recommending flexibility
exercises, the fitness professional must use good judgment and
communicate with the client and supervising medical professional to
obtain proper clearance.]{.mark}

**Static stretching**

[Static stretching is the process of passively taking a muscle to the
point of tension and holding the stretch for a minimum of 30 seconds.
This is a traditional form of stretching that is most often used in
current fitness professions. It combines low force with longer duration
stretch times. By holding the muscle in a stretched position for a
prolonged period, the muscle spindle becomes inhibited resulting in a
relaxation response. This allows the muscle to relax and provides for a
better lengthening reaction. In fact, static stretching may impact many
sensory mechanisms within the nervous system to facilitate a greater
stretch tolerance. In addition, contracting the antagonistic musculature
while holding the stretch can reciprocally inhibit the muscle being
stretched, allowing it to relax and enhance the effectiveness of the
stretch. For example, when performing the kneeling hip flexor stretch,
an individual can contract the hip extensors (gluteus maximus) to
reciprocally inhibit the hip flexors (psoas, rectus femoris), allowing
for greater lengthening of these muscles. Another example would be to
contract the quadriceps when performing a hamstring stretch. Static
stretching should be used to decrease the muscle spindle activity of an
overactive muscle before and after activity. Various static stretching
techniques are described in the following section.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[Does Static Stretching Impair Strength and Power?]{.mark}

[There has been much debate in the research and sport science
communities regarding the effects of static stretching on strength and
athletic performance. Several studies have cited that static stretching
impairs strength and power and recommend avoiding this technique prior
to exercise or sport competition.]{.mark}

[Looking at the research more closely, static stretching, when performed
acutely and in isolation, can temporarily impair muscular power due to
its relaxation response. This is especially true when stretches are held
for extended periods (2 minutes or longer) and performed in an acute
fashion (every now and again) and are the only form of exercise
performed prior to maximal effort (sprinting or jumping).]{.mark}

[However, static stretches, when performed for 30 seconds or less in a
chronic fashion (included prior to every workout) and followed by
dynamic activities, does not impair athletic performance.]{.mark}

[As such, NASM recommends performing static stretching, especially when
individuals exhibit limited joint ROM or muscle imbalances. Following
are some recommendations.]{.mark}

[Static stretches:]{.mark}

- [Should be held for 30 seconds]{.mark}

- [Only used on muscles identified as overactive during the assessment
  process]{.mark}

- [Followed by additional warm-up protocols, such as low-intensity core
  and balance exercises or dynamic stretching, to regain motor neuron
  excitability]{.mark}

**Static stretches**

[Static Gastrocnemius Stretch]{.underline}

[Stand in a lunge position with both feet pointing straight forward.
Make sure to keep the rear foot flat on the ground. Do not let the heel
rise. Shift weight forward until a stretch is felt in the rear calf
muscle.]{.mark}

[Static Soleus Stretch]{.underline}

[Stand in a lunge position with both feet pointing straight forward and
back knee slightly flexed. Make sure to keep the rear foot flat on the
ground. Do not let the heel rise up. Shift weight forward until a
stretch is felt in the rear calf muscle.]{.mark}

[Static 90/90 Hamstring Stretch]{.underline}

[Lie supine with one hip flexed 90 degrees (target leg) and the opposite
leg straight and flat on the floor. Straighten the target leg until a
mild stretch is felt in the hamstrings. The use of a rope or band is
suggested. The stretch should not cause pain or extreme
discomfort.]{.mark}

[Static Supine Biceps Femoris Stretch]{.underline}

[Lie supine with one hip flexed 90 degrees (target leg) and the opposite
leg straight and flat on the floor. Next, adduct the target leg across
the body and extend the knee until a mild stretch is felt in the lateral
hamstrings. The stretch should not cause pain or extreme discomfort.
Keep both shoulders flat on the ground during this stretch. Avoid
rotating the torso toward the stretched leg.]{.mark}

[Static Standing Biceps Femoris Stretch]{.underline}

[Use a low box or step to perform this stretch. Place one leg on top of
the box in an adducted and internally rotated position. Then, locking
the hands together, slowly rotate the torso in the opposite direction.
The stretched leg does not need to be elevated above hip height. This
stretch emphasizes the lateral hamstring.]{.mark}

[Static Seated Ball Adductor Stretch]{.underline}

[Sit on a stability ball in a lateral lunge position until a stretch is
felt in the inner thigh area. Posteriorly rotate the pelvis and draw in
the abdominals when performing this stretch.]{.mark}

position) until a stretch is felt in the inner thigh of the target leg.
Posteriorly rotate the pelvis and draw in the abdominals when performing
this stretch.]{.mark}

[Static Adductor Magnus Stretch]{.underline}

[While standing with one foot on a bench or plyo box, reach down to a
comfortable position without excessively rounding the spine until a
stretch is felt.]{.mark}

[Static Standing TFL Stretch]{.underline}

[Stand in a staggered stance with the front leg slightly bent and rear
leg straight. Externally rotate the rear foot, draw in the navel, and
posteriorly rotate the pelvis. Squeeze the gluteal muscles of the side

same shoulder. Do not allow the chin to jut forward or shoulders to
shrug during this stretch.]{.mark}

[Static Levator Scapulae Stretch]{.underline}

[Grasp the top of the head with one hand and laterally flex toward the
same shoulder. Next, slightly rotate the head to look in the axillary
(armpit) region as shown. Do not allow the chin to jut forward or
shoulders to shrug during this stretch.]{.mark}

[Static Sternocleidomastoid Stretch]{.underline}

[Grasp the top of the head with one hand and laterally flex toward the
same shoulder. Rotate the head up and away as shown. Only perform this
stretch to the point of mild tension. Do not allow the chin to jut
forward or shoulders to shrug during this stretch.]{.mark}

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[When assisting clients during a stretch, the fitness professional must
be careful not to overstretch the muscle. Overstretching can occur if
the muscle and joint are taken beyond their physiological limits.
Aggressive stretching can result in tissue and joint trauma. The general
signs of overstretching include but are not limited to (1) prolonged
joint pain or muscle soreness lasting more than 24 hours after
stretching, (2) edema (swelling) or inflammation of the involved area,
and (3) excessive muscle or joint pain during the stretch. Caution needs
to be taken when conducting flexibility exercises with clients who have
a current or preexisting joint or muscle injury.]{.mark}

**Active Stretching**

[Active stretching is the process of using agonists and synergists to
dynamically move the joint into a ROM. This form of stretching increases
motor neuron excitability, creating reciprocal inhibition of the muscle
being stretched. The active supine hamstring stretch is a good example
of active stretching. The quadriceps extend the knee. This enhances the
stretch of the hamstrings in two ways. First, it increases the length of
the hamstrings. Second, the contraction of the quadriceps causes
reciprocal inhibition (decreased neural drive and muscle spindle
excitation) of the hamstring complex, which allows it to elongate.
Active stretches are suggested for pre-activity warm-up, such as before
sports competition or high-intensity exercise. If an individual
possesses muscle imbalances, active stretching should be performed after
self-myofascial techniques and static stretching for muscles determined
as overactive during the assessment process. Typically, 5 to 10
repetitions of each stretch are performed and held for 1 to 2 seconds
each. Detailed explanations of various active-isolated techniques are
described in the following section.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[Static and active stretches typically require the same body position
and movement patterns. However, static stretches involve holding each
stretch for 30 seconds, whereas active stretches require holding the
stretch for only 1 to 2 seconds and repeating the motion for 5 to 10
repetitions. Active stretching can be considered a progression from
static stretching.]{.mark}

**Active stretches**

[Active Gastrocnemius Stretch]{.underline}

[Stand with back hip and knee straight (target leg). The opposite hip
and knee are flexed and swing back and forth across the body. This
motion causes rotation at the back knee and eversion and inversion of
the foot and ankle. Repeat for the desired number of
repetitions.]{.mark}

[Active Soleus Stretch]{.underline}

[Stand with back hip and knee slightly flexed (target leg). The opposite
hip and knee are flexed and swing back and forth across the body. This

Keep both shoulders flat on the ground during this stretch. Avoid
rotating the torso toward the stretched leg. Repeat for the desired
number of repetitions.]{.mark}

[Active Standing Adductor Stretch]{.underline}

forward or shoulders to shrug during this stretch. Repeat for the
desired number of repetitions.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[When performing static and active stretches, it is important to
maintain ideal posture. This requires performing a chin tuck and keeping
the head directly over the shoulders. Do not allow the head to jut
forward. This position keeps the cervical spine in a neutral position.
In addition, perform the drawing-in manoeuvre (slightly pull the navel
inward) to help maintain ideal stabilization of the spine.]{.mark}

**Dynamic Stretching and Controversial Stretches**

[Dynamic stretching uses the force production of a muscle and the body's
momentum to take a joint through the full available ROM. Dynamic
stretching uses the concept of reciprocal inhibition to improve soft
tissue extensibility. One can perform one set of 10 repetitions using 3
to 10 dynamic stretches. Dynamic stretching is also suggested as a
warm-up before athletic activity. If an individual does possess muscle
imbalances, self-myofascial techniques and static stretching should
precede dynamic stretching for overactive muscles identified during the
assessment process. It is recommended that the client has good levels of
tissue extensibility, core stability, and balance capabilities before
undertaking an aggressive dynamic stretching program. Detailed
explanations of various dynamic stretches are presented in the following
section.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[Dynamic stretches are often used in a specific warm-up protocol. These
stretches tend to mimic movements used during an exercise session or
sport competition. For example, a fitness professional may have a client
perform a series of pushups prior to initiating the bench press exercise
or hip swings prior to performing squats.]{.mark}

[When implementing dynamic stretching, it is important to adequately
prepare the client for activity while simultaneously avoiding undue
fatigue. The goal is to prepare the body for more intense activity
rather than cause breathlessness and exhaustion.]{.mark}

**Dynamic stretches**

[Prisoner squat]{.underline}

[With arms behind the head and feet approximately shoulder-width apart,
perform a bodyweight squat. As a progression to this exercise, add a
calf raise at the top position after performing the squat.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Lunge with Reach]{.underline}

[Perform the lunge in all three planes of motion: sagittal, frontal, and
transverse. In other words, perform a forward lunge, lateral lunge, and
turning lunge.]{.mark}

[Lunge with Rotation]{.underline}

[Perform a forward lunge with trunk rotation toward the outside portion
of the forward leg. This exercise can be performed with or without an
external load, such as a medicine ball.]{.mark}

[Tube Walking: Side to Side]{.underline}

[Place elastic tubing around the knees, maintain a quarter squat
position, and sidestep for the desired number of repetitions in each
direction. Make sure the knees are tracking in line with the second and
third toes. Do not allow the knees to cave inward. This exercise
primarily targets the hip abductors, such as the gluteus medius. The
band can also be placed around the ankles (as shown) as a progression to
this exercise.]{.mark}

[Leg Swings: Front to Back]{.underline}

[In standing position, swing one leg in a controlled pendulum fashion to
the front and back, only lifting the leg as high as can safely be
controlled. Keep a tall, upright posture with the abdominals drawn in
during the duration of the exercise.]{.mark}

[Leg Swings: Side to Side]{.underline}

[In standing position, swing one leg in a controlled pendulum fashion
from side to side. Like front to back hip swings, keep a tall, upright
posture with the abdominals drawn in during the duration of the
exercise.]{.mark}

[Frankenstein]{.underline}

[This technique is performed while walking forward with arms stretched
out away from the body. Only lift each leg as high as can be safely
controlled while maintaining ideal posture. Keep a neutral back without
leaning to the left or right. This exercise helps stretch the
hamstrings.]{.mark}

[High Knee]{.underline}

[This technique is performed while walking forward. With each step, flex
the hip as high as can be controlled, grasping the knee at the top with
both hands. Be sure to pause at the top and switch legs with each
step.]{.mark}

[Push-Up with Rotation]{.underline}

[Perform a bodyweight push-up with a trunk rotation at the top. Keep the
abdominals drawn in, chin tucked, and spine in a neutral position
throughout the exercise.]{.mark}

[Ball Russian Twist]{.underline}

[While bridging on a stability ball, perform trunk rotation. This
exercise targets the internal and external obliques in addition to the
gluteus maximus because it requires the participant to maintain a
bridged position. The exercise can be performed with or without external
load, such as using a medicine ball.]{.mark}

[Arm Circles]{.underline}

[Perform arm circles in both directions using a slow to moderate
speed.]{.mark}

[Jumping Jacks]{.underline}

[When performing jumping jacks as a dynamic warm-up, the goal is to
slightly elevate heart and respiration rates without causing undue
fatigue.]{.mark}

[Jump Rope]{.underline}

[Many movements can be performed with a jump rope. Choose movements your
client can safely perform. It is also important to keep the intensity
relatively low to moderate when integrating this exercise into a warm-up
routine.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[Flexibility training is a key component to a comprehensive fitness
program for clients of all levels. Often, flexibility is implemented in
the warm-up or cool-down phase of a client's workout. Depending on
individual needs, a combination of flexibility exercise may provide the
best results. Researchers have found that combining static and dynamic
stretching reduces the risk for muscle injury and increases flexibility.
This combination does not have any detrimental effects on muscle
performance, which makes it ideal for a warm-up or cool-down.
Researchers also found that short bouts of self-myofascial rolling
increase flexibility, enhance pre-exercise muscle performance, and
decrease postexercise soreness and fatigue. The fitness professional
should consider a combination of interventions to meet individual client
needs. Ideally, self-myofascial rolling and static stretching should be
performed prior to active or dynamic stretching to first address
restricted ROM.]{.mark}

**Controversial Stretches**

[Although flexibility training has numerous benefits, performing certain
types of stretches may be a risk for injury. Although most stretches are
very safe when performed correctly with proper posture and technique,
there are a few controversial stretches that may be potentially
dangerous.]{.mark}

[Inverted hurdler's stretch]{.underline}

[This stretch is thought to place high stress on the inside of the knee
(medial collateral ligament) and may cause pain and stress on the
patella (kneecap) (right knee in Figure 14-18). This stretch should not
be performed by anyone with a history of knee or low-back pain or
injury. Health professionals believe this stretch should not be
performed by most patients or general wellness clients.]{.mark}

[Plow]{.underline}

[The plow exercise is a common posture from yoga. Because of the
inverted nature of this stretch (head is lower than the hips), this
stretch places high stress on the neck and spine. If this stretch is not
done with exact technique, it may place the spine at risk of injury.
Clients with a history of neck or back injury should not perform this
stretch owing to the high stress it places on these structures. This
position should also be avoided by individuals with high blood pressure
(hypertension).]{.mark}

[Shoulder stand]{.underline}

[The shoulder stand is another common posture from yoga and another
inverted stretch. As with the plow, this position places high stress on
the neck, shoulders, and spine. It should be avoided in patients with
hypertension or any history of neck or spine injury, or if exact
technique is not used.]{.mark}

[Straight-leg toe touch]{.underline}

[The straight-leg toe touch is one of the most common stretches for the
hamstring complex. This position may place the vertebrae and the
cartilage discs in the low-back under high stress. Any client or patient
with a history of herniated discs or nerve pain that runs down the back
of the leg should avoid this stretch. In addition, clients with poor
flexibility may attempt to hyperextend the knees during this stretch,
which may place high stress on the ligaments of the knee.]{.mark}

[Arching quadriceps]{.underline}

[The arching quadriceps stretch is designed to stretch the quadriceps
and hip flexors. This position places very high stress on the kneecap
and the other tissues on the front of the knee joint. Any client with a
history of knee injury should avoid this stretch. Owing to the high
stress (compression) of the kneecap into the knee during this stretch
(which may cause damage to the cartilage), most healthcare professionals
discourage anyone from performing this exercise.]{.mark}

[The fitness professional must recognize that some individuals, such as
athletes, may need to perform the stretches because the position is
required for their sport or activity. For instance, the inverted
hurdler's stretch mimics the position of a hurdler going over a hurdle.
Others are traditional positions used in martial arts, gymnastics, or
yoga. However, for most clients, there are safer positions that can be
used to stretch the targeted muscles. Therefore, all clients should be
properly educated about stretching technique and posture, and the safest
exercises should be used to meet the goals of the exercise
program.]{.mark}
