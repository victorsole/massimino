### Essential concepts of balance

[The ability to maintain postural control or balance is a fundamental
component of performance, injury resistance, and rehabilitation that
follows an injury. Technically, balance can be defined as the ability to
maintain one's centre of gravity within that person's base of support.
The centre of gravity is the approximate midpoint of the body; while the
location may vary between individuals, it is typically located at the
midportion of the trunk. The base of support represents the area beneath
a person that consists of every point of contact made between the body
and the support surface (i.e., the floor). For example, the width
between the feet of a standing individual would define the base of
support. If an individual is standing still, the centre of gravity can
move within the limits of stability, as found within the base of
support. The limits of stability mean the area within which an
individual can move one's centre of gravity without changing the base of
support (i.e., moving the feet) without falling.]{.mark}

[Balance can be classified into static, semi-dynamic, and dynamic.
Static balance applies to situations when an individual seeks to
maintain postural control within a stationary position; for example, the
individual is standing still on one foot. Semi-dynamic balance refers to
instances when an individual seeks to maintain balance within a
stationary limit of stability, yet the base supporting the body is in
movement (e.g., individual riding on a skateboard). Dynamic balance
occurs when a person seeks to maintain their centre of mass over an
ever-changing limit of stability; for example, the individual is running
on uneven surfaces.]{.mark}

[Maintaining balance in these various conditions requires integration of
multiple systems, including vision, vestibular, and somatosensory
systems, as well as properly timed muscle contractions, to maintain the
centre of mass within the limits of stability. The ability to maintain
balance during various conditions is important for optimizing
performance, reducing injury risk, and enhancing rehabilitation efforts.
Thus, it is important for fitness professionals to understand the
mechanisms and benefits of balance training as a vital component of care
for all clients.]{.mark}

[There may be many reasons why an individual has impaired balance. In
general, an individual with a musculoskeletal injury (i.e., a ligament
sprain or a muscle pull) or an alteration of sensorimotor function
(i.e., due to a concussion or the normal process of aging) may have
deficits in balance and likely benefits from balance training programs.
The fitness professional can improve clients' functionality across the
spectrum of health and wellness by using individualized, comprehensive,
and systematic balance training programs.]{.mark}

**Mechanisms of balance**

[The ability to feel that the centre of mass (COM) is moving toward a
person's limits of stability is a product of three sense-based systems:
vision, vestibular, and somatosensation. Vision is typically used to
provide information to the central nervous system about the body's
location in space. Balance may be more difficult when an individual's
eyes are closed, because this person is no longer able to use vision to
determine bodily position in space. Individuals may use vision to
determine the best foot placement to maintain balance when moving over
unstable surfaces. The vestibular system is controlled by sensory
receptors in the inner ear and provide the brain information about
spatial orientation and the movement of the head in space.]{.mark}

[Vestibular receptors are important for maintaining balance while
bending over, as well as dynamic movements, like hopping or squatting.
Somatosensation refers to the ability to feel changes in pressure on the
skin, muscle length, and joint angles. Somatosensation is critically
important for balancing on unstable surfaces and tasks that involve
dynamic balance. It is possible that individuals may prioritize
information gained from one sense over the other two. Therefore, fitness
professionals should incorporate balance training techniques that stress
each of these senses to ensure their clients' capability in attending to
sensory information that arises from each of these three critical
senses.]{.mark}

**Scientific rationale for balance training**

[Researchers have shown that balance training can be effective at
optimizing performance, improving resistance to injury, and enhancing
rehabilitation. It is important for fitness professionals to understand
the scientific basis for balance, ways to design a balance routine
catering to the needs of the client, and methods to effectively
communicate and efficiently implement a balance training
program.]{.mark}

[Performance]{.underline}

[Several studies have demonstrated successful improvement in balance
ability after healthy, physically active individuals have completed a
balance training program. A systematic review found that 10-minute
balance training programs, in which children performed three times per
week for 4 weeks, appear to improve both their static and dynamic
balance ability. Balance training has been shown successful in improving
motor function of muscles in the lower extremity, as well as
neuromuscular control, especially for those who have suffered from
chronic ankle sprains. Individuals with musculoskeletal injuries can
improve their ability to maintain their centre of mass within their
limits of stability by specifically engaging in balance
training.]{.mark}

[Balance training should be incorporated into overall training programs,
because balance training may improve additional performance metrics
important to clients. For example, adding balance training to a
resistance-training program can enhance lower extremity muscle strength
gains, indicating that resistance-training regimens should include
balance training to optimize strength gains.]{.mark}

[In older individuals, balance training can improve functionality when
applied to activities of daily living (e.g., chores, shopping, grooming,
bathing), which may decrease their overall disability.]{.mark}

[Furthermore, balance training tends to improve vertical jump
performance in youth basketball players when compared to isometric
strength training. Similarly, performing balance training along with
agility exercises may improve dynamic balance during eyes-open and
eyes-closed conditions, as well as improve agility-based outcomes and
reaction time. Therefore, balance training should be considered as an
important component of improving performance.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[Balance training has been shown to improve balance and coordination,
which are necessary components in the process of becoming a well-rounded
athlete. For safety reasons, balance exercises and equipment (e.g., foam
pad, balance disc, wobble board) should not be used in conjunction with
heavy loads, such as maximal or near maximal lifts.]{.mark}

[Injury resistance]{.underline}

[Balance training is an important component to emphasize when developing
a program to improve injury resistance, whether the fitness professional
is working with an athlete participating in a sport or a client whose
goal is to perform daily living activities without falling.]{.mark}

[Balance exercises are commonly included in lower extremity programs,
referred to as injury prevention programs, for athletes to bolster
resistance to injury. When designing injury prevention programs, these
components are typically incorporated: stretching, strength, plyometric,
and balance activities. Comprehensive injury prevention programs that
include balance training have been shown to improve landing mechanics,
which may decrease the risk of lower extremity injuries. Youth soccer
athletes who participated in a 9-week injury prevention program
demonstrated improvements in time-to-stabilization (a measure of balance
ability), as well as vertical jump height. Female basketball athletes
who participated in a 5-week balance training program improved landing
movement mechanics and muscle activation during a single-limb landing,
which may reduce the risk of certain lower extremity injuries, like an
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. In fact, collegiate athletes
with poor balance during landing tasks were at an increased risk of ACL
rupture. A systematic review demonstrated that athletes undergoing
balance training reduced the risk of suffering an ankle sprain by 46%
when compared to athletes lacking any balance training.]{.mark}

[The fitness professional can also tailor balance activities to be sport
specific; for example, a basketball athlete can balance on one leg while
passing the basketball back and forth. When incorporating balance
training into an injury prevention program for athletes, ensuring
activity performance in the sports environment with minimal equipment
may improve compliance and overall adherence across a season.]{.mark}

[Balance training is also beneficial for older adults. Falls are one of
the leading causes of injuries and health-related complications in older
adults. While both external (i.e., environmental) and internal (i.e.,
muscle strength) factors may influence the risk of falling, the body's
balance system plays a critical role in allowing an individual to
maintain control over their own body's placement and prevent a fall. In
exercise programs that include balance training, research has shown up
to a 20% reduction in the risk of falls in older healthy adults.]{.mark}

[Balance training is a recommended intervention to be included in
multifactorial training programs, which also include stretching and
strengthening, for adults older than 65 years of age with a history of
falling. Physical exercise interventions, including balance training
that challenges posture in different positions, have been shown to
reduce the number of falls in healthy older adults. A comprehensive
8-week exercise program that included progressively challenging balance
activities showed older adults' improvement in both physical performance
and psychological confidence. When working with an older adult, it is
important to ask the client if they have complaints of imbalances, such
as feelings of unsteadiness or fear of falling, because individuals with
these perceptions show a higher rate of falls. This information will
help the fitness professional to properly incorporate balance training
activities into the training plan.]{.mark}

+------------------------------------------------------------------+

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[When working with an older adult client, make sure to conduct a
thorough preparticipation health screening and identify if your client
is capable of performing balance training exercises. Some clients may
need clearance by their healthcare provider to take part in a balance
training program. Fitness professionals must ensure they are informed of
any medical conditions that may influence the ability to balance, from a
safety standpoint.]{.mark}

[Rehabilitation]{.underline}

[Balance training has been shown to enhance rehabilitation for various
individuals following lower extremity injuries, such as ankle sprains
and ACL injuries. Because some clients may have decreased balance, it is
imperative to understand balance and how to design a balance routine
that caters to the needs of the client.]{.mark}

[High school athletes with chronic ankle instability who completed a
4-week balance training program during rehabilitation using a
biomechanical ankle platform system board significantly improved both
static and dynamic single-limb balance compared to those who did not do
balance training as a part of their rehabilitation. Using either a
traditional single-limb balance program (single-limb stance, single-limb
stance with ball toss and kicking, step-down with single-limb stance) or
a progressive hop-to-stabilization balance program (various single-limb
hop-to-stabilization exercises) improved self-reported function,
semi-dynamic balance, and joint position sense in athletes with chronic
ankle instability.]{.mark}

[Deficits in balance ability may persist for an extended period
following an injury. A recent study found that individuals following an
ACL reconstruction demonstrated worse semi-dynamic balance on both
injured and uninjured limbs as far as 1 year postsurgery compared to
healthy controls. Therefore, athletes with a prior knee injury will
benefit from balance training programs for both limbs when working with
a Certified Personal Trainer.]{.mark}

[Additionally, balance training is important to enhance rehabilitation
of individuals at risk for a fall or after a fall. Using
perturbation-based balance training in a safe and controlled environment
significantly reduced the incidence of falls in older adults. A
perturbation is a mechanism where a postural disturbance is added to a
task (i.e., lightly pushing on a client's shoulders as they are
balancing), which causes the client to learn to maintain or recover
balance.]{.mark}

+------------------------------------------------------------------+

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[Certified Personal Trainers are not qualified to diagnose an injury or
perform medical rehabilitation, as it is beyond their scope of practice.
However, once the client has been cleared by a medical professional
(i.e., physician, physical therapist), fitness professionals play an
important role in helping balance-impaired individuals regain and
continue to improve functionality, whether for simple activities of
daily living or high-level sports. Consistent, clear communication
between medical and fitness professionals is critical to ensure safety
for the client and optimize the exercise program to help the client
achieve personal goals.]{.mark}

**Importance of properly training the balance system**

[An effective balance training program should challenge the threshold of
an individual's limit of stability. This threshold must be stressed in a
multiplanar, proprioceptively enriched environment, using functional
movement patterns to improve static, semi-dynamic, and dynamic
balance.]{.mark}

[Training in a proprioceptively enriched environment with appropriate
types of balance equipment (i.e., floor, balance beam, half-foam roll,
foam pad, balance disc, wobble board), correct technique, and at varying
speeds facilitates maximal sensory input to the central nervous system.
It also prepares the body for various scenarios that it may encounter in
the real world, such as landing from a jump for an athlete or stepping
off a curb for an older adult.]{.mark}

[Fitness professionals are encouraged to implement progressive,
systematic training programs to develop consistent, long-term changes in
their clients. Training program designs that only focus on strength
training protocols often deliver incomplete results, because the
training program does not challenge the balance mechanisms of the human
body. Balance training fills this gap by focusing on functional movement
patterns in a multisensory, unstable environment. The design and
implementation of balance exercises into a training program is critical
for developing, improving, and restoring the synergy of muscle firing
patterns required for dynamic balance and coordinated movement.]{.mark}

**Guidelines for balance training**

[Balance exercises are a vital component of any integrated training
program, because they help ensure optimal muscle recruitment and
coordinated movement. Balance training exercises must be systematic and
progressive. Fitness professionals should follow specific program
guidelines, including proper exercise selection criteria and milestones
for progression. Balance is improved through repetitive exposure to a
variety of proprioceptively enriched environments.]{.mark}

+--------------------------+---------------------------------------+

[\*These modalities come in many shapes and sizes that will dictate
proper progression.]{.mark}

[The main goal of balance training is to continually increase the
client's awareness of their limit of stability by increasing the
proprioceptive demands of the exercise. An example of challenging the
proprioceptive demand could range from having a 65-year-old client
balance on the floor in a tandem stance (heel-to-toe posture) to having
a 25-year-old athlete balance on one foot while standing on a balance
disc.]{.mark}

**Designing a balance training program**

[A proper balance training program should be systematic and progressive.
Exercises can be progressed or regressed by changing the requirements
for surface, visual condition, and body position or movement. Surfaces
will change in difficulty as an individual moves from a stable surface
(floor) to an unstable surface (e.g., half-foam roll, foam pad, or
balance disc). Keeping the eyes open during an exercise is easier than
having the eyes closed (visual input), moving the head around to look at
various objects (vestibular input), or performing a cognitive task
simultaneously (dual-task condition). Moving the contralateral
(opposite) leg, trunk, or arms also makes a balance exercise more
challenging, whereas standing on two legs (versus a single leg)
simplifies the exercise. Caution should be used to change only one
variable at a time. Following this strategy of progressions will enable
the fitness professional to easily adapt exercises for each individual
client, regardless of age or level of fitness.]{.mark}

[Balance training progressions]{.underline}

[When introducing balance exercises into an exercise program, the
exercises should initially involve little joint motion of the balance
leg. These entry-level balance exercises are designed to improve
reflexive (automatic) muscle contractions to increase joint stability.
Using this protocol, the body is placed in an unstable environment, so
it learns to react by contracting the right muscles at the right time to
maintain balance.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[The market currently offers several training modalities (i.e., types of
equipment) that challenge one's balance, and they can be very useful
tools. However, to ensure the safety and effectiveness of balance
training, individuals must start in an environment they can safely
control and go through a systematic progression (i.e., floor, balance
beam, half-foam roll, foam pad, and balance disc). Wobble boards can
also be included in the progression, but the type of structure of the
wobble board will dictate proper progression. Failing to follow the
proper progression can cause movement compensations and improper
executions of the exercise, decreasing the effectiveness of the exercise
and increasing the risk for injury.]{.mark}

[These types of exercises should be mastered before moving to more
difficult forms of balance training. Sample exercises that follow this
protocol include (but are not limited to) the following:]{.mark}

- [Tandem stance]{.mark}

  [Single-leg balance]{.mark}

  [Single-leg balance reach]{.mark}

  [Single-leg hip internal and external rotation]{.mark}

  [Single-leg lift and chop]{.mark}

  [Single-leg arm and leg motion]{.mark}

  [Single-leg windmill]{.mark}

  [Single-leg throw and catch]{.mark}

[The next progression involves dynamic eccentric and concentric movement
of the balance leg through a full range of motion. Movements require
dynamic control in the mid-range of motion, with isometric stabilization
at the end-range of motion. The speed and neural demands of each
exercise are progressed. Sample exercises following this protocol
include (but are not limited to) the following:]{.mark}

- [Single-leg squat]{.mark}

  [Single-leg squat touchdown]{.mark}

  [Single-leg Romanian deadlift]{.mark}

  [Multiplanar step-up to balance]{.mark}

  [Multiplanar lunge to balance.]{.mark}

[The last progression includes exercises that are designed to develop
proper deceleration ability to move the body from a dynamic state to a
controlled stationary position. In other words, these exercises combine
hopping motions with a single-leg stance landing (holding the landing
position for 3--5 seconds). Exercises in this level include (but are not
limited to) the following:]{.mark}

- [Multiplanar hop with stabilization]{.mark}

  [Multiplanar single-leg box hop-up with stabilization]{.mark}

  [Multiplanar single-leg box hop-down with stabilization.]{.mark}

[The preceding paragraphs described methods for progressing balance
exercises by increasing demands to body position and limb
movement.]{.mark}

[To reiterate:]{.mark}

[Progression 1. Exercises should initially involve little joint motion
of the balance leg.]{.mark}

[Once these types of exercises have been mastered, a fitness
professional can choose to make these exercises more challenging (if
deemed appropriate) by integrating the following:]{.mark}

1.  [Balance modalities (e.g., balance beam, half-foam roll, foam pad,
    balance disc, wobble board)]{.mark}

2.  [Cognitive, dual-task scenarios (e.g., naming the months of the year
    while balancing on one limb)]{.mark}

3.  [Closing eye tasks]{.mark}

4.  [Head or eye movement]{.mark}

[Progression 2. Exercises should involve movement of the balance leg
through a full range of motion.]{.mark}

[Once these types of exercises have been mastered, a fitness
professional can again choose to make these exercises more challenging
(if deemed appropriate) by integrating the following:]{.mark}

- [Balance modalities]{.mark}

- [Cognitive, dual-task scenarios]{.mark}

- [Closing eye tasks]{.mark}

- [Head or eye movement]{.mark}

[Progression 3. Exercises should combine hopping motions with a
single-leg stance landing, and holding the balance position for 3--5
seconds.]{.mark}

[Once these types of exercises have been mastered, a fitness
professional can again choose to make these exercises more challenging
(if deemed appropriate) by integrating the following:]{.mark}

- [Balance modalities]{.mark}

- [Cognitive, dual-task scenarios]{.mark}

- [Closing eye tasks]{.mark}

- [Head or eye movement]{.mark}

[It is important to plan exercise progressions to challenge the balance
system by manipulating one variable at a time. The progressions
implemented should be client-specific based on their own unique physical
capabilities.]{.mark}

**Five kinetic chain checkpoints**

[As with any training method, proper form and technique must be mastered
to ensure proper muscle activation and to avoid injury. The skill
required for balance training requires adequate focus and conscious
attention during regular practice, especially to minimize the risk of
falls while ensuring the lower limbs and trunk remain in ideal posture.
As with all exercises, quality should always come before quantity or
weight progression, and the five kinetic chain checkpoints should be
monitored:]{.mark}

1.  [*Feet* pointing straight ahead]{.mark}

2.  [*Knees* in line with the second and third toes (avoid allowing
    knees to cave inward)]{.mark}

3.  [*Hips* level and in a neutral position]{.mark}

4.  [*Shoulders* in a neutral position (not protracted or
    elevated)]{.mark}

5.  [*Head* with cervical spine in a neutral position (chin
    tuck)]{.mark}

**Balance exercises**

[Tandem Stance]{.underline}

[If necessary, position client next to a sturdy object that they can
hold on to in case they lose their balance.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Balance]{.underline}

[Make sure the gluteal musculature of the balance leg remains contracted
while performing this and all balance exercises to help stabilize the
lower extremity.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Balance Reach]{.underline}

[Keep the hips level when performing balance exercises. This will
improve balance and decrease stress to the low-back.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Hip Rotation]{.underline}

[Make sure when performing this exercise to rotate through the hip of
the balance leg versus the spine. This will decrease stress to the spine
and enhance control of the core.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Lift and Chop]{.underline}

[When performing balance exercises, make sure the knee of the balance
leg always remains aligned with the toes.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Arm and Leg Motion]{.underline}

[Move the contralateral limbs in a range of motion that can be safely
performed while maintaining ideal posture.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Windmill]{.underline}

[Move the trunk through a range of motions that can be safely performed
while maintaining ideal posture. This requires adequate core
stabilization in addition to maintaining balance.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Throw and Catch]{.underline}

[The fitness professional can use several methods to increase the demand
of this exercise:]{.mark}

- [Toss the medicine ball at various heights and across the body]{.mark}

- [Increase the distance between both individuals]{.mark}

- [Increase velocity of each throw]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Squat]{.underline}

[As mentioned earlier, make sure the knee always remains aligned with
the toes without moving inside or outside the second and third toes.
This will decrease stress to the knee.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Squat Touchdown]{.underline}

[If the client cannot touch their foot, have them first work on reaching
to their knee, next to their shin, and finally to their foot.]{.mark}

[Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift]{.underline}

[Use the same progression with this exercise as performed in the
single-leg squat touchdown:]{.mark}

1.  [Reach to the knee]{.mark}

2.  [Reach to the shin]{.mark}

3.  [Reach to the foot]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Step-Up to Balance]{.underline}

[At the end position, make sure that the hip of the balance leg is in
full extension for maximal recruitment of the gluteal
musculature.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Lunge to Balance]{.underline}

[When performing a lunge, make sure the stride length is not too large,
particularly if one has tight hip flexors. This can force the lumbar
spine into excessive extension, increasing stress to the lower
back.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Hop with Stabilization]{.underline}

[Make sure the landing is soft and quiet to ensure efficient acceptance
of forces through the tissues, and keep the knee aligned with the second
and third toes.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Single-Leg Box Hop-Up with Stabilization]{.underline}

[Choose a box or platform with a height suitable for the client's
ability level.]{.mark}

[Multiplanar Single-Leg Box Hop-Down with Stabilization]{.underline}

[Once again, keep the knee in line with the toes when landing, and land
as softly as possible.]{.mark}
