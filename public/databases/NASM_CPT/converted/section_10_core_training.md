### Core Training

[Core training is critical for improving posture, enhancing performance,
increasing resistance to injury, and accelerating injury rehabilitation.
A properly designed core training program can be a key component of an
overall training plan used to achieve a broad range of goals. The
objective of core training is the development of core stability,
endurance, strength, and power. Core stability and core endurance refer
to the ability of an individual to maintain proper spinal and hip
posture while the extremities (i.e., arms and legs) are moving. Core
strength refers to the ability to contract the torso in all directions
(i.e., flexion, extension, rotation), and core power involves explosive
movements of the core musculature. There are multiple muscle groups that
make up the core region, which are commonly characterized as local or
global musculature. To properly stabilize and strengthen the core, both
local and global core muscles must work together.]{.mark}

**Core musculature**

[Certified Personal Trainers must have a basic understanding of
functional anatomy to understand the principles of core training. The
core, also known as the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex (LPHC), includes a
space within the body that has the following boundaries: diaphragm
superiorly, abdominal muscle anteriorly and laterally, lumbar spine and
gluteal muscles posteriorly, and pelvic floor and hip musculature
inferiorly. In simpler terms, the core region is at the body's centre of
gravity and includes (but is not limited to) the abdominals, hips,
gluteal complex, and low-back area. The core musculature can be divided
into two unique categories: the local muscles and the global muscles. To
maintain optimal stability and function of the core, it is important to
systematically condition all muscles of the core. Together, the local
and global muscles work to stabilize the spine while producing efficient
arm and leg movements. These muscles work together to produce strong,
effective movements of the trunk while continuing to stabilize the
spine. Optimal lengths of muscles (or length-tension relationships) and
recruitment of muscles (or force-couple relationships) of the LPHC,
along with coordinated joint motions, are important for producing
effective and efficient movements.]{.mark}

+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**Local muscles**

[Local muscles generally attach on or near the vertebrae and often have
short attachments ranging between one and two vertebrae segments. Local
muscles provide dynamic control of the spinal segments that limit
excessive compression, shear, and rotational forces between spinal
segments. This is important for stabilizing the vertebrae and limiting
strain on passive stabilizing structures, including intervertebral discs
and ligaments. Local muscles consist primarily of type I (slow twitch)
muscle fibres, which have a high density of muscle spindles and are
important for assisting in proprioception of the spine. Therefore, the
appropriate function of local core muscles is important for maintaining
proper posture of the vertebral column during strengthening exercises
and other dynamic movements.]{.mark}

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[Developing movement strategies that effectively stabilize the spine by
activating local muscles, prior to the initiation of extremity
movements, is important for minimizing improper loading of the spine and
reducing the risk of injury.]{.mark}

[Additionally, appropriate posture throughout the spine is important for
ensuring proper extremity movements, thereby enhancing the performance
of the entire neuromuscular system. It is important to remember that
dysfunction of local core musculature can be present in individuals with
strong global core musculature. Therefore, exercises that activate,
strengthen, and build endurance in local core muscles should still be
incorporated into all core training programs.]{.mark}

**Global muscles**

[Global core musculature is positioned more superficial on the trunk
when compared to local core musculature. The global muscles of the core
act to move the trunk, transfer loads between the upper and lower
extremities, and provide stability of the spine by stabilizing multiple
segments together as functional units. These muscles are primarily
responsible for concentric force production and eccentric deceleration
during dynamic activities. The primary global muscles of the core
include (but are not limited to) the rectus abdominis, external
obliques, latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, hip flexors, and extrinsic
(superficial) erector spinae.]{.mark}

[Collectively, all of the muscles within each system provide dynamic
stabilization and neuromuscular control of the entire core. The global
muscles produce force (concentric actions), attenuate force (eccentric
actions), and provide stabilization in all planes of movement during
dynamic activities. In isolation, global muscles do not effectively
achieve stabilization of the LPHC; rather it is through their
cooperative functioning with the local musculature that they enhance
stability and neuromuscular control. To better understand how these
muscles work to stabilize the LPHC, it helps to view the systems from
the inside out (local muscles â†’ global muscles). In other words,
training the global muscles before training the local muscles would not
be ideal from both a structural and biomechanical standpoint. Doing so
could be compared to building a house without a foundation. The
foundation must be developed first to provide a stable platform for the
remaining components of the house to be built on. One must first be
stable to move efficiently.]{.mark}

**Importance of properly training the core muscles**

[Some active individuals have developed strength, power, and muscular
endurance of the global muscles of the core, which enables them to
perform dynamic activities. Few people, however, have properly trained
the local muscles required for intervertebral stabilization. The local
muscles have to function efficiently for an individual to effectively
use the strength, power, and endurance that has been developed in the
prime movers (i.e., arms, legs). If the global muscles are strong and
the local muscles are weak, forces along the kinetic chain might not be
transferred or used properly. This leads to compensation, inefficient
movements, and the potential for injury. Weakness of the global and
local core musculature is a fundamental problem that causes inefficient
movement and can lead to poor posture, decreased athletic performance,
increased risk of injury, and inability to adequately return to activity
following a previous injury. For this reason, properly training local
and global core musculature is essential for maintaining proper posture
and improving performance, as well as increasing injury resilience and
enhancing injury rehabilitation.]{.mark}

**Scientific rationale for core training**

[When designing a core training program, it is important to incorporate
exercises specific to the needs of each client. Core training has
multiple benefits; therefore, core training may be considered
fundamental to many overall training programs for the vast majority of
clients. Scientific evidence exists to support the importance of core
training for the following key areas: optimizing posture, performance,
injury resistance, and rehabilitation.]{.mark}

[Optimising posture]{.underline}

[The human spine demonstrates naturally occurring curvatures that
alternate between lordotic (inward/concave) curvatures in the cervical
and lumbar spine and kyphotic (outward/convex) curvatures in the
thoracic and sacral spine. These spinal curvatures develop naturally as
individuals move from crawling to walking. Maintenance of these spinal
curvatures throughout the life span is important for proper energy
distribution throughout the spine. Proper core muscle function is
critical for maintaining natural spinal curvatures, which can be
increased or decreased as a result of improper core muscle balance.
Overactivity of the hip flexors and superficial erector spinae and
underactivity of the abdominals have been correlated with increased
anterior pelvic tilt, which is associated with increased lumbar
(low-back) lordosis. Conversely, overactivity of the hamstrings and
rectus abdominis and underactivity of the erector spinae can rotate the
pelvis posteriorly, known as a posterior pelvic tilt.]{.mark}

[While the spine may exhibit small deviations from midline in the
frontal plane, large curvatures of the spine away from midline are
considered abnormal and may be classified as scoliosis. While scoliosis
can often result from altered bone shape through the spine (structural
scoliosis), functional scoliosis (nonstructural scoliosis) can be
influenced by muscle imbalances, particularly muscle imbalances between
right and left sides of the body. This leads to altered alignment of the
spine in the frontal plane. Core muscle strengthening has been found to
improve spinal alignment in individuals with functional
scoliosis.]{.mark}

[Additionally, hip musculature (e.g., gluteus medius) functions to
maintain a level position of the pelvis. Improper positioning of the
pelvis may result in improper postures of the spine. It is not clear if
altered posture causes low-back pain (LBP) or if LBP results in altered
posture. Gluteus medius weakness is common in individuals with LBP and
should be addressed as a way to manage the link between abnormal posture
and LBP. Therefore, proper core strength and stability are linked to
proper posture, which is the reason maintaining proper body positioning,
or form, should be emphasized while exercising as well as performing
activities of daily life.]{.mark}

### Performance

[A strong and stable core is important for generating strong and
explosive movements needed for optimal physical performance.]{.mark}

[The core can be thought of as a foundation for producing and
transmitting strong and controlled movements to the lower extremity and
generating force production for the upper extremities. Therefore,
improving core performance, including strength, endurance, and
coordinated muscle activation, should be viewed as a critical component
of improving movements requiring upper and lower limb speed, strength,
and endurance. There is evidence that core muscles activate prior to
movements in the lower extremity, suggesting that proper core muscle
function is essential for preparing the primary lower extremity movers
to generate force. Core stability and core strength are associated with
increased lower extremity muscle strength (and increased take-off
velocity of a vertical jump, as well as maximal squat
performance.]{.mark}

[Core muscle strengthening programs have been linked to improved speed
and kicking performance, as well as dynamic balance and jumping
distance. Core muscle endurance is also critical to lower extremity
muscle performance. Previous research has demonstrated that core muscle
fatigue can result in altered cycling biomechanics. Similarly, fatiguing
the core musculature results in decreased shoulder strength, suggesting
that core endurance is critical for upper extremity muscle performance.
Preparatory trunk movements occur prior to moving the upper limb
extremity, suggesting proper trunk stability is needed to maximize upper
extremity performance. Additionally, improving core strength results in
increased shoulder strength. Athletes who participate in throwing
activities strengthened gluteal function, which is connected to better
pelvis and torso biomechanics, and sling-based core training, which
involves suspension of the limbs using unstable sling or cord systems,
results in improved throwing velocity. Core training improved 50-meter
swimming sprint times, suggesting core training can translate to
improved performance in nonweight-bearing activities that engage both
upper and lower extremity function.]{.mark}

[Injury resistance]{.underline}

[Core muscle function is critical for proper extremity movements.
Therefore, optimal core muscle function has been considered a factor
that may modify injury risk. A prospective cohort study demonstrated
that lower postural control, hip muscle strength, and core muscle
endurance were predictive of individuals who developed overuse
musculoskeletal injuries over a 1.5-year period. Core muscle training
has been found to improve balance, and a meta-analysis concluded that
core strength training was an important factor in fall prevention. Core
stability has become a key component of prevention programs aimed at
decreasing acute lower extremity injuries, such as anterior cruciate
ligament tears. The ability to properly stabilize the trunk during jump
landing is critical to achieving optimal landing mechanics that may
decrease the risk of knee injury. In a randomized controlled trial, 4
weeks of core stability training produces similar decreases in forces at
the knee during jump landing in female high school athletes to
individuals who participated in 4 weeks of plyometric training.]{.mark}

[Rehabilitation]{.underline}

[LBP is one of the leading causes of global disability, and core muscle
training is commonly used to rehabilitate patients with LBP. Researchers
have found that individuals with chronic LBP have decreased activation
of certain muscles or muscle groups, including the transverse abdominis,
internal obliques, pelvic floor muscles, multifidus, diaphragm, gluteal
complex, and deep erector spinae. A meta-analysis evaluating more than
2,400 individuals demonstrated that core exercise is effective in
improving outcomes in those with LBP. Core stabilization exercises
restore the size, activation, and endurance of the multifidus (deep
spine muscle) in individuals with LBP. The addition of core stability
exercises to traditional rehabilitation for people with LBP demonstrates
improvements in pain compared to traditional rehabilitation.]{.mark}

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[It is important for fitness professionals to work closely alongside
healthcare providers, who are trained to diagnose and treat individuals
with injuries. It is beyond the scope of practice for a Certified
Personal Trainer to diagnose an injury or perform the functions of a
licensed rehabilitation specialist (e.g., physical therapist,
physiotherapist, chiropractor, orthopedist).]{.mark}

[Clients with LBP can be taught to improve functionality of core muscles
to improve core stability and reduce LBP. For example, performing an
abdominal drawing-in maneuver increases muscle activation of the
transverse abdominis. Transverse abdominis activation improves with 4
weeks of training in those with and without LBP. Using proper exercise
techniques can reduce pain in those with LBP. Using hyperextension
exercises without proper LBP stabilization has been shown to increase
pressure on the discs to dangerous levels. These unsupported exercises
can cause damage to the ligaments that support the vertebrae, which may
lead to a narrowing of the vertebrae openings that spinal nerves pass
through. Therefore, it is crucial for fitness professionals to
incorporate a systematic, progressive approach when training the core,
ensuring the local core muscles that stabilize the spine are
strengthened before or in conjunction with the global musculature that
moves the spine and extremities.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[Electromyography is a procedure that measures the electrical conducting
function of nerves in muscles. An electromyography is able to identify
differences in muscle or muscle group activation when performing
different movements or exercises.]{.mark}

**Drawing-in manoeuvre**

[Research has demonstrated that electromyography activity is increased
during pelvic stabilization and transverse abdominis activation when an
abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre is initiated before activity. Research
has found that the transverse abdominis, when properly activated,
creates tension in the thoracolumbar fascia (connective tissue of the
low-back area), contributing to spinal stiffness, and compresses the
sacroiliac joint, increasing stability. These findings have led other
researchers to further understand and demonstrate the important role of
the transverse abdominis on spinal stability and LBP. To perform the
drawing-in manoeuvre, pull in the region just below the navel toward the
spine and maintain the cervical spine in a neutral position. Maintaining
a neutral spine, or the normal curvatures of the spine during core
training helps improve posture, muscle balance, and stabilization. If a
forward protruding head is noticed during the drawing-in manoeuvre, the
sternocleidomastoid is preferentially recruited. If the
sternocleidomastoid muscle is overactive and extends the upper cervical
spine, the pelvis rotates anteriorly to realign the eyes. This can lead
to muscle imbalances and decreased pelvic stabilization.]{.mark}

**Abdominal bracing**

[Bracing is referred to as a co-contraction of global muscles, such as
the rectus abdominis and external obliques. Bracing is also commonly
referred to as a "bearing down" or tightening of the global muscles by
consciously contracting them. Research has shown that muscular endurance
of global and local musculature, when contracted together, create the
most benefit for those with LBP compared with traditional LBP training
methods, such as solely emphasizing range of motion at the spine.
Bracing focuses on global trunk stability, not simply on segmented
vertebral stability, meaning that the global muscles, given the proper
endurance training, will also work to stabilize the spine.]{.mark}

[However, both the drawing-in manoeuvre and bracing can be implemented
in a core training program to help retrain the strength, endurance, and
motor control of local and global muscular systems and movement
musculature. Activation of the local stabilization system and the global
stabilization system has been demonstrated to preferentially activate
these specific muscles during core training.]{.mark}

**Guidelines for core training**

[A comprehensive core training program should be systematic,
progressive, and functional and emphasize the entire muscle action
spectrum focusing on force production (concentric), force reduction
(eccentric), and dynamic stabilization (isometric). A core training
program should regularly manipulate planes of motion, ranges of motion,
body position, speed of execution, and specific acute training variables
(e.g., sets, reps, intensity, tempo, frequency).]{.mark}

[When designing a core training program, the fitness professional should
initially create a proprioceptively enriched training environment.
Proprioception training offers a controlled yet unstable training
environment with a selection of appropriate exercises to elicit a
maximal training response and involves activities that emphasize
awareness of body position in space. Core exercises performed in an
unstable environment (such as with a stability ball) have been
demonstrated to increase activation of the local and global
stabilization system.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[The use of weight belts for apparently healthy adults engaging in a
moderately intense exercise program is not recommended. Weight belts may
raise an individual's heart rate and systolic blood pressure and often
give individuals a false sense of security and the misconception that
they can lift heavier loads. Instead, fitness professionals need to
educate their clients as to appropriate exercise technique and proper
activation of the body's natural belt: the core musculature.]{.mark}

[Core Training for Rehabilitation and Sport Performance]{.mark}

- [Linde et al. (2018) found that abdominal bracing during a single-leg
  squatting task led to greater activity of the global abdominal muscles
  in healthy females when compared to abdominal hollowing and control
  conditions.]{.mark}

  [Motealleh evaluated trunk postural balance on an unstable sitting
  platform in young women with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome
  (PFPS). They found impaired trunk postural control in the women with
  PFPS, suggesting that rehabilitation for these patients should
  incorporate isolated core training to improve recovery and
  function.]{.mark}

  [Tsai investigated whether core training through control and strength
  of the trunk and hip would improve landing biomechanics and muscle
  strength in adolescent male volleyball athletes. Following a 6-week
  core training program, athletes demonstrated a more controlled
  (upright) trunk posture during landing and improved strength of key
  hip and knee musculature, suggesting that core training may be
  important to incorporate into training programs for jumping
  athletes.]{.mark}

  [Lima found that adults with a history of LBP and disability who
  underwent a 10-week core and mobility training program, including
  guidelines for the most appropriate core posture during work and
  activities of daily living, had reduced LBP intensity perception and
  low-back functional disability compared to individuals who did not
  follow this program.]{.mark}

  [Sung demonstrated that an integrated and specialized 8-week core
  training and nondominant arm strength training program resulted in
  larger improvements in drive distance compared to golfers who did no
  exercise or core-only exercise for 8 weeks.]{.mark}

**Designing a core training program**

[The goal of core training is to develop optimal levels of stability,
muscular endurance, strength, and power. Increasing proprioceptive
demand by using a multisensory environment and using multiple exercise
modalities (balls, bands, balance equipment) is more important than
increasing the external resistance. The quality of movement should be
emphasized more than quantity, and the focus of the program should be on
coordinated movement across the kinetic chain.]{.mark}

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[Neural adaptations become the focus of the program instead of striving
for absolute strength gains.]{.mark}

[The following is an example of an integrated core training program. The
client begins at the highest level at which they are able to maintain
stability and optimal coordinated movement. The client progresses
through their program after mastering the exercises in the previous
level while simultaneously demonstrating intervertebral and lumbopelvic
stability. To evaluate appropriate intervertebral stability, the client
will be able to maintain the drawing-in position while performing
various exercises. The client would have appropriate lumbopelvic
stability when they are able to perform functional movement patterns,
such as squats, lunges, and step-ups, without excessive spinal
motion.]{.mark}

[Core training programs must be designed to achieve the following
functional outcomes. The sequence is critical for optimizing
function:]{.mark}

1.  [Intervertebral stability (stabilization of individual spinal
    segments)]{.mark}

2.  [Lumbopelvic stability (stabilization of lumbo-pelvic-hip
    complex)]{.mark}

3.  [Movement efficiency (improved movement quality and force
    output)]{.mark}

**Core training progressions**

[When initiating a core training program, exercises should initially
focus on stabilization through the spine and pelvis without gross
movement of the trunk. These exercises are designed to improve
neuromuscular efficiency and intervertebral stability, focusing on
drawing-in and then bracing during the exercises. Sample exercises that
follow this protocol include (but are not limited to) the
following:]{.mark}

- [Marching]{.mark}

- [Floor bridge]{.mark}

- [Ball bridge]{.mark}

- [Floor cobra]{.mark}

- [Ball cobra]{.mark}

- [Fire hydrant]{.mark}

- [Plank]{.mark}

- [Side plank]{.mark}

- [Dead bug]{.mark}

- [Bird dog]{.mark}

- [Pallof press]{.mark}

- [Farmer's carry.]{.mark}

[The next progression is to involve more dynamic eccentric and
concentric movements of the spine throughout a full range of motion. In
other words, these exercises involve flexion, extension, and rotation of
the trunk. It is always important for the fitness professional to
communicate with a client's healthcare provider to determine if there
are any underlying medical conditions that may warrant avoiding certain
exercises. In this progression, specificity, speed, and neural demands
are also increased using moderate to fast repetition tempos. These
exercises are designed to improve lumbopelvic stability, concentric
strength (force production), eccentric strength (force reduction), and
neuromuscular efficiency (coordination) of the core. Sample exercises
that follow this protocol include (but are not limited to) the
following:]{.mark}

- [Floor crunch]{.mark}

- [Ball crunch]{.mark}

- [Back extension]{.mark}

- [Reverse crunch]{.mark}

- [Knee-up]{.mark}

- [Cable rotation]{.mark}

- [Cable lift]{.mark}

- [Cable chop.]{.mark}

[The last progression includes exercises that are designed to improve
the rate of force production (power) and movement efficiency of the core
musculature and extremities. These forms of exercise prepare an
individual to dynamically stabilize and generate force at more
functionally applicable (explosive) speeds. Example exercises include
(but are not limited to) the following:]{.mark}

- [Medicine ball rotation chest pass]{.mark}

- [Ball medicine ball pullover throw]{.mark}

- [Front medicine ball oblique throw]{.mark}

- [Side medicine ball oblique throw]{.mark}

- [Medicine ball soccer throw]{.mark}

- [Medicine ball woodchop throw]{.mark}

- [Medicine ball overhead throw.]{.mark}

### Five kinetic chain checkpoints

[As with any training method, proper form and technique must be mastered
to ensure proper muscle activation and avoid injury. The skill for core
training requires adequate focus and practice. Without inward focus and
conscious attention to technique, injury may occur, especially as
exercises become more explosive. Honing all skills with exquisite
technique for each exercise is essential. Moreover, as with all
exercises, improving quality should always come before increasing
quantity or weight, and the five kinetic chain checkpoints should be
monitored:]{.mark}

1.  [*Feet*: Approximately shoulder-width apart (when appropriate) and
    pointing straight ahead (when appropriate)]{.mark}

2.  [*Knees*: In line with the second and third toes (avoid allowing
    knees to cave inward)]{.mark}

3.  [*Hips*: Level and in a neutral position]{.mark}

4.  [*Shoulders*: Neutral position (not protracted or elevated)]{.mark}

5.  [*Head*: Cervical spine in a neutral position (chin tuck)]{.mark}

**Core exercises**

[Marching]{.underline}

[Make sure to keep the abdominals drawn in throughout the entire
exercise to target the local core muscles. Abdominal protrusion
indicates poor activation of the local core.]{.mark}

### Floor Bridge

[SAFETY]{.mark}

[When performing a bridge, do not raise the hips too far off the floor
(hyperextending the low-back). This places excessive stress to the
lumbar spine. Make sure at the end position, the knees, hips, and
shoulders are in alignment and the gluteal muscles are fully
contracted.]{.mark}

[Ball bridge]{.underline}

[Make sure to rest the head and shoulders on top of the stability ball
to maximize comfort and reduce stress on the head and neck. Like the
floor bridge, do not allow hyperextension of the low-back.]{.mark}

[Floor Cobra]{.underline}

[Like the ball bridge, do not come too high off the floor
(hyperextending the low-back). The focus of the exercise is to retract
and depress the shoulder blades. As such, be sure to externally rotate
both arms and point the thumbs into the air.]{.mark}

[Ball Cobra]{.underline}

[Perform this exercise like the floor cobra, but it is best to place the
feet against a sturdy object for extra support (not shown).]{.mark}

[Fire Hydrant]{.underline}

[Perform this exercise with the abdominals drawn in and head in a
neutral position. This exercise helps strengthen the hip external
rotators.]{.mark}

[Plank]{.underline}

[If this version of the exercise is too difficult for a client to
perform, some regression options include the following:]{.mark}

- [Perform in a standard push-up position]{.mark}

- [Perform in a push-up position with the knees on the floor]{.mark}

- [Perform with the hands on a bench and the feet on the floor]{.mark}

[Side Plank]{.underline}

[Keep all kinetic chain checkpoints in alignment; do not allow the
pelvis to drop toward the floor. This is an excellent exercise to target
the transverse abdominis muscle.]{.mark}

[Dead Bug]{.underline}

[This is another excellent exercise to target the local core muscles,
but it may take some practice to coordinate all movements. As with other
core exercises, maintain a neutral spine and core activation throughout
the duration of the exercise.]{.mark}

[Bird Dog]{.underline}

[Keep the spine in a neutral position throughout the exercise and point
the thumbs straight up toward the sky. Do not allow the low-back to
excessively arch.]{.mark}

[Kneeling Palloff Press]{.underline}

[The Pallof press is an antirotation exercise designed to target the
local core muscles. Be sure to keep the hips and shoulders square and
maintain all five kinetic chain checkpoints during the exercise.]{.mark}

[Farmer's Carry]{.underline}

[This is an advanced exercise depending on the load (weight) used.
During this exercise, it is important to brace the abdominals and avoid
excessive rotation or lateral flexion of the spine. Instead, keep an
upright posture.]{.mark}

[Floor Crunch]{.underline}

[Do not perform a full sit-up. Rather, the movement only involves
lifting the shoulder blades off the floor. This limits recruitment of
the hip flexor muscles and may be safer for the low-back.]{.mark}

[Ball Crunch]{.underline}

[Make sure to keep the chin tucked while performing the exercise. This
will take stress off of the muscles of the cervical spine.]{.mark}

[Back Extension]{.underline}

[At the end position of the exercise, makes sure the ankles, knees,
hips, shoulders, and ears are all in alignment. Do not hyperextend the
low-back.]{.mark}

[Reverse Crunch]{.underline}

[Do not swing the legs when performing this exercise. Once you have
positioned the lower extremities during the setup, they should not move
during the execution of the exercise. Swinging the legs increases
momentum, increasing the risk of injury and decreasing the effectiveness
of the exercise.]{.mark}

[Knee-Up]{.underline}

[The knee-up is performed in a similar fashion to the reverse crunch
except the knees are fully extended. During the concentric phase, extend
the feet toward the ceiling by lifting the hips off the bench then
slowly lowering the hips back to the starting position.]{.mark}

[Cable Rotation]{.underline}

[To decrease stress to the low-back, make sure to pivot the back leg
into triple extension:]{.mark}

- [Hip extension]{.mark}

- [Knee extension]{.mark}

- [Ankle plantarflexion (extension)]{.mark}

[This also ensures proper coordination of the muscles that extend the
lower extremities (gluteus maximus, quadriceps, and calves).]{.mark}

[Cable Lift]{.underline}

[Do not hyperextend the low-back at the top position. Keep a neutral
spine throughout. Like the cable rotation, the back leg should pivot
into triple extension at the end of the movement.]{.mark}

[Cable Chop]{.underline}

[The cable chop is an opposite motion of the cable lift exercise. This
time the back leg will be in flexion rather than extension.]{.mark}

[Medicine Ball Rotation Chest Pass]{.underline}

[It is imperative that clients demonstrate proper stabilization and
strength before performing explosive core exercises. Performing these
exercises without proper stabilization and strength may lead to movement
compensations, muscle imbalances, and injury.]{.mark}

[Ball Medicine Ball Pullover Throw]{.underline}

[It is important that an individual has proper extensibility of the
latissimus dorsi before performing this exercise to decrease stress to
the low-back and shoulders.]{.mark}

[Front Medicine Ball Oblique Throw]{.underline}

[From an athletic position, bring the medicine ball to one hip and then
explosive toss the ball to a wall or partner in front of you while
keeping your hips and feet pointing straight ahead. Repeat on the
opposite side.]{.mark}

[Side Medicine Ball Oblique Throw]{.underline}

[The back leg should pivot into triple extension after tossing the
medicine ball.]{.mark}

[Medicine Ball Soccer Throw]{.underline}

[It may be easier to perform this exercise using a D-ball (a medicine
ball that does not bounce back) or close to a wall to bounce the
medicine ball off.]{.mark}

[Medicine Ball Woodchop Throw]{.underline}

[In most cases, do not use an overly heavy medicine ball. The goal of
this exercise is to increase the rate of core force production versus
absolute strength.]{.mark}

[Medicine Ball Back Extension Throw]{.underline}

[Most of the rotational motion should come from the thoracic spine
instead of the lumbar spine.]{.mark}
