### Cardiorespiratory fitness training

[Cardiorespiratory fitness reflects the ability of the cardiovascular
and respiratory systems to supply oxygen-rich blood to skeletal muscles
during sustained physical activity. Cardiorespiratory fitness is one of
the five components to health-related physical fitness; the others
include muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body
composition. Cardiorespiratory fitness is vitally important to health
and wellness as well as to the ability to engage in normal activities of
daily living (ADL) without excessive fatigue. Physical activity and
exercise training programs should be designed with the intent of
improving each of the key components of health-related physical fitness;
however, from the standpoint of preventing chronic disease and improving
health and quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness training should
always be near top priority when allocating time and resources during
the design and implementation of any exercise training program because
of the number of health-related benefits associated with it.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[The five components of fitness include the following:]{.mark}

- [Cardiorespiratory (aerobic) fitness]{.mark}

- [Muscular strength]{.mark}

- [Muscular endurance]{.mark}

- [Flexibility]{.mark}

- [Body composition]{.mark}

[Cardiorespiratory training is a way of planning training programs that
systematically progress clients through various stages to achieve
optimal levels of physical and performance adaptations by placing stress
on the cardiorespiratory system. One of the most common errors made by
fitness professionals during the planning and implementation of
cardiorespiratory exercise programs is the failure to consider rate of
progression. Rate of progression is critical to help clients achieve
their personal health and fitness goals in the most efficient and
effective use of time and energy. In addition, failure to carefully
consider and monitor rate of progression of each client on an individual
basis can also result in injury if progression is too fast, or in poor
exercise adherence if the progression is too slow. Thus, applying proven
scientific principles to the design of cardiorespiratory fitness
training programs will help ensure that clients maximize their potential
to achieve optimal levels of physical and performance
adaptations.]{.mark}

**Benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness**

[The benefits of regular physical activity and structured exercise are
numerous. Individuals can achieve numerous health-related benefits from
modest amounts of moderate-intensity exercise and even greater benefits
from vigorous-intensity exercise, or a combination of both. Engaging in
regular, sustained physical activity over one's life span is one of the
most reliable predictors of death and disability. In fact, research has
confirmed that an individual's cardiorespiratory fitness level is a
strong predictor of morbidity and mortality. In other words, poor
cardiorespiratory fitness is related to a marked increase in risk of
premature death from all causes, but particularly from cardiovascular
disease. Conversely, an improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness is
related to a reduction in premature death from all causes.]{.mark}

[Research demonstrates that cardiorespiratory exercise and physical
activity provide many benefits that enhance health, longevity, and
weight loss. Individuals who are more active on a regular basis enhance
their likelihood for attaining these benefits, whereas sedentary
individuals may experience rapid deteriorations in their overall health
and well-being.]{.mark}

**General guidelines for cardiorespiratory fitness training**

[Fitness professionals need to understand and appreciate the fact that
no two individuals will ever respond and adapt to cardiorespiratory
exercise in exactly the same way. In other words, the physical and
perceptual responses to exercise are highly variable, even among
individuals of similar age, fitness, and health. Thus, all exercise
training recommendations, including cardiorespiratory exercise, must be
individually determined and should use the FITTE-VP principle. FITTE-VP
stands for "frequency, intensity, type, time, enjoyment, volume, and
progression."]{.mark}

**Frequency**

[Frequency refers to the number of training sessions in a given time
period, usually expressed as per week. Moderate-intensity exercise
(e.g., brisk walking) should be performed at least five times per week,
whereas vigorous-intensity exercise (e.g., jogging or running) should be
performed at least three times per week, or a combination of
moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity is also acceptable.]{.mark}

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Intensity**

[Intensity refers to the level of demand that a given activity places on
the body. For general health requirements, such as reducing the risk of
chronic disease, moderate-intensity is recommended. Moderate exercise
typically represents an intensity range that is enough of a demand to
increase heart and respiratory rate but does not cause exhaustion or
breathlessness for the average untrained apparently healthy adult. In
other words, the individual should be able to talk comfortably during
exercise or physical activity. Higher intensities are generally required
for improvements in overall fitness and conditioning. However, any
combination of the two will also result in improved health.]{.mark}

[Methods for assigning exercise intensity]{.underline}

[Cardiorespiratory exercise intensity can be monitored in numerous ways.
Some methods for monitoring cardiorespiratory exercise intensity include
calculating VO2max, using percentages of maximal heart rate (HRmax),
percentages of heart rate reserve (HRR), metabolic equivalents (METs),
ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and the talk test. Some of these
methods are more practical for fitness professionals to implement with
clients than others.]{.mark}

[VO2max]{.underline}

[The traditional gold standard measurement for cardiorespiratory fitness
is VO2max, often expressed as the maximal volume of oxygen consumed per
kilogram of body weight per minute (mL/kg per min). In other words,
VO2max is the maximal amount of oxygen that an individual can use during
intense exercise. Once VO2max is determined, a common method to
establish exercise training intensity is to have clients exercise at a
percentage of their VO2max.]{.mark}

[However, accurately measuring VO2max is oftentimes impractical for
fitness professionals because it requires clients to perform
cardiorespiratory exercise at maximal effort and sophisticated equipment
to monitor the client's ventilation response (oxygen consumed and carbon
dioxide expired). Thus, submax­imal aerobic tests have become popular for
fitness professionals to estimate VO2max.]{.mark}

[Maximal heart rate]{.underline}

[Calculating HRmax is another method for establishing training intensity
during cardiorespiratory exercise. Although measuring a client's actual
maximal heart rate is effective, it is also impractical for fitness
professionals because it requires testing clients at maximal capacity.
Subsequently, many mathematical formulas that estimate HRmax have been
developed. Once HRmax is calculated, fitness professionals can have
clients exercise at a certain percentage of their HRmax.]{.mark}

[Arguably the most commonly used formula for estimating HRmax is 220 --
age. However, this formula was never intended to be used as an
instrument for designing cardiorespiratory fitness programs because
maximal heart rate varies significantly among individuals of the same
age. Dr. William Haskell (one of the developers of the aforementioned
formula) has been quoted as saying, "The formula was never supposed to
be an absolute guide to rule people's training".]{.mark}

[For this reason, more appropriate regression formulas have been
developed, such as the Tanaka formula, where HRmax is determined using
the following formula: 208 -- (0.7 × age). It has been shown that this
formula is more accurate than Haskell's 220 -- age formula for
estimating an individual's HRmax.]{.mark}

[Keep in mind, fitness professionals should never use this, or any other
mathematical formula, as an absolute. A person's heart rate response to
exercise is dependent on many additional factors, including genetics,
medications, and stimulant use such as caffeine. However, the Tanaka
formula is very simple to use and can be easily implemented as a general
starting point for measuring cardiorespiratory training
intensity.]{.mark}

[Consider the following example of a 40-year-old client who is tasked at
exercising at 65% of her HRmax. The formula would be solved as
follows:]{.mark}

[Tanaka formula: 208 -- (0.7 × age) = HRmax]{.mark}

[208 -- (0.7 × 40) = HRmax]{.mark}

[208 -- (28) = HRmax]{.mark}

[180 = HRmax]{.mark}

[180 beats per minute (bpm) is the client's estimated HRmax:]{.mark}

[180 × 65% = 117]{.mark}

[Thus, 117 bpm is the client's target heart rate.]{.mark}

[Heart rate reserve]{.underline}

[HRR, also known as the Karvonen method, is a method of establishing a
client's target heart rate based on the difference between a client's
estimated HRmax and their resting heart rate. This formula is likely
more appropriate versus only calculating a percentage of HRmax because
it considers an individual's resting heart rate, which tends to vary
from person to person. The heart rate reserve formula is defined as
follows:]{.mark}

[\[(HRmax -- HRrest) × desired intensity\] + HRrest = Target heart
rate]{.mark}

[Consider the following example of a 25-year-old client with a desired
training intensity of 85% of his HRmax. If this 25-year-old client has a
resting heart rate of 50 bpm (which is considered very good), then the
formula (using the Tanaka formula to determine HRmax) would be solved as
follows:]{.mark}

[\[(HRmax -- HRrest) × desired intensity\] + HRrest = Target heart
rate]{.mark}

[208 -- (0.7 × 25) = 191 HRmax]{.mark}

[191 (HRmax) -- 50 (HRrest) = 141]{.mark}

[141 × 85% (desired intensity) = 120]{.mark}

[120 + 50 (HRrest) = 170 bpm]{.mark}

[Thus, 170 beats per minute is the client's target heart rate.]{.mark}

[Metabolic equivalent]{.underline}

[One MET is equal to 3.5 millilitres of oxygen consumed per kilogram of
body weight per minute (3.5 mL O2 · kg--1 · min--1) or the equivalent of
the average resting metabolic rate for adults. In other words, this
represents the amount of oxygen used by an individual at true rest. METs
are used to describe the energy cost of physical activity as multiples
of resting metabolic rate. MET values are used to relate exercise
intensity with energy expenditure. For example, a physical activity with
a MET value of 4, such as jogging at a slow pace, requires four times
the energy than a person uses at rest (e.g., sitting quietly). There are
many resources available for fitness professionals that describe common
activities and their average MET values. However, this method is an
uncommon practice within a fitness facility.]{.mark}

[Ratings of perceived exertion method]{.underline}

[RPE is a popular method for estimating exercise intensity. RPE is a
technique used to validate how hard a client feels they are working
during exercise. When using the RPE method, a person is subjectively
rating the perceived difficulty of exercise and is based on the physical
sensations, such as increased heart rate, increased respiration rate,
increased sweating, and muscle fatigue. The client's subjective rating
should be reported based on the overall feelings of how hard they are
working, including an overall sense of fatigue, and not just isolated
areas of the body (i.e., tired legs during cycling). Although the RPE
scale is a subjective measure, if clients report their exertion ratings
accurately, RPE does provide a good estimate of exercise training
intensity.]{.mark}

[There are two versions of RPE: the original 6 to 20 scale and the newer
1 to 10 scale. The Borg 6 to 20 is the standard, yet it can be somewhat
confusing because it starts at a score of 6 (rather than zero) and has
15 different choices. The reason behind the 6 to 20 scale is that each
value corresponds to a heart rate, and most adult heart rates range
between 60 bpm and 200 bpm. Subsequently, a Borg score of 6 corresponds
to a heart rate of 60 bpm, whereas a Borg score of 12 corresponds to a
heart rate of 120 bpm. However, for simplicity and ease of use, we
recommend fitness professionals use the 1 to 10 scale with their
clients, unless their clients are familiar with the 6 to 20 Borg
scale.]{.mark}

[Talk test]{.underline}

[Historically, the talk test has been an informal method used to gauge
exercise training intensity during exercise. The belief has always been
that if clients reach a point at which they are not able to carry on a
simple conversation during exercise because they are breathing too hard,
then they are probably exercising at a high-intensity level. Several
studies have now confirmed that there is a correlation between the talk
test, VO2, ventilatory threshold (Tvent), and heart rate during both
cycle ergometer and treadmill exercise. Thus, it appears that the talk
test can help fitness professionals and clients monitor proper exercise
intensity without having to rely on measuring heart rate or
VO2max.]{.mark}

[When clients can speak comfortably, they are typically exercising below
the intensity of ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1). At the first point where
clients can no longer speak comfortably during continuous speech (i.e.,
continuous talking becomes challenging), this intensity approximates
VT1. This relationship between the talk test and VT1 has been
demonstrated to be valid in several populations ranging from
well-trained athletes to sedentary individuals and patients with
cardiovascular disease.]{.mark}

**Time**

[Time refers to the length of time engaged in an activity or exercise
training session and is typically expressed in minutes. According to the
most current public health guidelines on physical activity, adults
should accumulate 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of
moderate-intensity aerobic activity (i.e., brisk walking) every week or
1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic
activity (i.e., jogging or running) every week, or an equivalent mix of
moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. The guidelines also
recommend that if adults exceed 300 minutes per week of
moderate-intensity activity or 150 minutes per week of
vigorous-intensity activity, then they will gain even more health and
fitness benefits. However, it is also important for fitness
professionals to appreciate that any duration of physical activity or
exercise, regardless of the individual or accumulated time, can provide
some positive health benefits.]{.mark}

**Type**

[Type refers to the mode of activity selected. It should be noted that
there are three criteria that must be met for an activity or exercise to
be considered "aerobic" exercise. For a mode of exercise to be
considered aerobic, it should (a) be rhythmic, (b) use large muscle
groups, and (c) be continuous in nature. Some examples of modes of
aerobic exercise include the following:]{.mark}

- [Jogging]{.mark}

- [Walking]{.mark}

- [Exercising on cardio equipment]{.mark}

- [Swimming]{.mark}

- [Cycling (indoors or outdoors)]{.mark}

[In addition to recognizing modes or types of cardiorespiratory
exercise, such as swimming or cycling, it is also important for fitness
professionals to be familiar with various cardio formats. Many of these
formats also involve stressing both aerobic and anaerobic energy
pathways and include interval training, high-intensity interval
training, Tabata, and Fartlek training.]{.mark}

[Interval training]{.underline}

[Interval training has received a great amount of research attention
over the years. This training format involves brief periods of higher
exertion efforts coupled with lower-intensity periods. The exertion
efforts (i.e., intervals) can be moderate to highly intense, depending
on the goals, needs, and abilities of the client.]{.mark}

[Work-to-rest ratios can be calculated and altered to change the stress
applied during each workout. Generally, ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:5
are used to provide adequate recovery within each interval; however,
work-to-rest ratios can vary dramatically depending on the client's
fitness level and the mode of exercise performed. Fitness professionals
can alter both the intensity and work-to-rest ratios to vary training
stress throughout the program.]{.mark}

[Moderately intense intervals involve exercise at a medium intensity
with the goal to complete a set number of programmed intervals rather
than reach maximal or near-maximal effort during each iteration.
Moderate intensities are best for beginning exercisers and for
occasional reduction in overall training stress to avoid
overtraining.]{.mark}

[High-intensity intervals place a considerable challenge on the
metabolic energy systems by pushing the client to near-maximal effort
during each repetition. This type of interval training is commonly known
as high-intensity interval training (HIIT).]{.mark}

[High-intensity interval training]{.underline}

[*HIIT* is a term commonly used today to describe shorter bouts of
high-intensity work at maximal or near-maximal performance (e.g.,
sprinting) followed by recovery periods (e.g., slow jog or walking).
Although interval training has a long-standing reputation in the realm
of sports conditioning given the stop-start nature of many sports, its
popularity has grown within recreational fitness due to its compressed
timeframe for achieving improvements in physical fitness and health when
compared to continuous exercise methods.]{.mark}

[HIIT has been shown to be an effective mode for improving
cardiorespiratory fitness because it can produce comparable results in a
compressed period of time and with a smaller volume of work. It also
aids in weight loss and reduction of cholesterol levels and blood
pressure in a similar manner to steady-state (SS) aerobic exercise. Even
though HIIT training offers a key benefit of time efficiency (i.e., less
time exercising), not all clients will adhere to its strenuous demands,
nor is it required to achieve most health or wellness goals.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[When designing HIIT training programs, recognize that "effort" is a
subjective measure (e.g., how hard I am pushing myself), whereas
"intensity" is an objective measure (e.g., sprint time, load lifted),
and they are not the same. If a workout does not provide adequate
recovery between intervals, then the intensity of the workout has to
decrease, even if the individual's effort is at a maximum.]{.mark}

[Tabata training]{.underline}

[Tabata is a type of HIIT training and was created by a Japanese
scientist named Dr. Izumo Tabata. The Tabata format involves performing
a maximal effort interval lasting 20 seconds, followed by only 10
seconds of rest. The client performs a total of eight intervals, for a
total of 4 minutes. This format has been shown to improve aerobic power
and improvements in VO2max.]{.mark}

[However, a true Tabata format is rarely taught in health clubs. Dr.
Tabata and his team of researchers performed their study using elite
cyclists as subjects in which each interval was performed at
approximately 170% of VO2max. Most fitness enthusiasts are incapable of
performing or sustaining exercise at this intensity. Moreover, a true
Tabata workout session would only last 4 minutes. However, variations of
Tabata training are popular, in which intervals are still high intensity
yet the participant can successfully complete the program. It is
important for fitness professionals to select interval intensities that
are appropriate for their clients and consider their client's fitness
level and tolerance to intense exercise.]{.mark}

[Fartlek training]{.underline}

[*Fartlek* is a Swedish term that translates to "speed play." The goals
of fartlek training are highly variable, targeting many different
physiological systems (i.e., aerobic and anaerobic) by combin­ing
different formats into one workout. It is often performed while running,
but it can also be completed while cycling or swimming. Unlike
steady-state or HIIT formats, Fartlek training is unstructured and
combines low-, moderate-, and high-intensity efforts into one workout.
Far­tlek training helps break the monotony often associated with one
format of training.]{.mark}

**Enjoyment**

[Enjoyment refers to the amount of pleasure derived from engaging in a
specific exercise or activity. Unfortunately, this component of exercise
programming is often overlooked or not considered more seriously.
Exercise adherence rates decline significantly when a specific mode of
exercise is selected for a client before considering their personality
type, previous exercise experiences, and other interests. If the mode of
activity or exercise training program is not enjoyable to a client, it
is highly likely that they will not adhere to the exercise program and
therefore not achieve their personal health and fitness goals. A client
is much more apt to continue with a program that is fun and challenging
and includes a supportive environment than one that is dull and
boring.]{.mark}

**Volume**

[Volume of exercise represents the total amount of work performed in
each timeframe, typically 1 week. As mentioned previously, public health
guidelines recommend adults accumulate 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
aerobic activity every week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic
activity every week, or an equivalent mix of the two.]{.mark}

[However, 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity may only
provide modest weight loss. Individuals who are seeking to lose weight
will likely achieve greater benefits from the inclusion of more than 250
minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Research also reveals that for
general health improvements and the prevention of weight gain,
individuals should aim to expend 1200 to 2000 calories through physical
activity per week.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[Because it is very difficult to expend 1200 calories or more per week
through structured exercise, experts suggest including nonstructured
physical activity into one's daily routine. Recent research has
demonstrated that expending calories throughout the day through
unstructured physical activity is important for health and weight loss
efforts. This has shifted some attention away from structured, planned
exercise a few times per week as a standalone to including nonexercise
activity thermogenesis (NEAT). NEAT represents all the energy expended
throughout the day that does not include eating, sleeping, or structured
exercise. This energy includes calories expended through fidgeting,
standing and moving around, and performing basic tasks of daily living
(e.g., chores, grooming) and most often represents a greater quantity of
expended calories in a day than what is accumulated through a single
exercise session.]{.mark}

**Progression**

[Progression refers to how an exercise program advances. Exercise
protocols should gradually progress in intensity and/or volume to
continually challenge the individual. However, the rate of progression
should be specific to the individual and their needs, goals, and
abilities. The client's health status, physical abilities, and responses
to exercises must be considered. For example, progression for a
21-year-old elite athlete will differ from a 65-year-old sedentary
adult.]{.mark}

[A gradual increase of exercise volume (\<10% per week) appears to be a
safe protocol for most apparently healthy adults. This approach may also
increase adherence to the exercise pro­gram because the exerciser feels
competent to perform the work and complete the program.]{.mark}

[Fitness professionals must be careful and plan cardiorespiratory
training programs accord­ing to their client's ability level. Risk of
musculoskeletal injury (e.g., sprains, strains) can occur if intensity
of exercise is progressed too quickly.]{.mark}

STRETCH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

[If a client is exercising for 150 minutes per week (30 minutes, 5 days
per week), then a 10% increase in volume would be:]{.mark}

[150 X 10% = 15]{.mark}

[150 + 15 = 165 minutes per week]{.mark}

**Recommendations**

[The most current public health guidelines on physical activity, which
are based on scientific evidence, recommend adults engage in 150 minutes
per week of moderate-intensity activity (i.e., brisk walking) to help
improve their overall health and fitness and reduce their risk for
developing numerous chronic diseases. The guidelines also recommend that
if adults exceed 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity or
150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity activity, then they will gain
even more health benefits.]{.mark}

[The guidelines presented represent physical activity guidelines for all
adults, especially those who are currently sedentary or have little
previous experience with exercise. If clients are not able to achieve
the suggested minimal guidelines for cardiorespiratory training of 150
minutes per week (or 30 minutes, five times per week) of
moderate-intensity aerobic activity on at least 5 days per week, they
can break it up into shorter increments, for example 10 minutes at a
time, until 150 minutes per week is met.]{.mark}

**Components of cardiorespiratory fitness training**

[Exercise training programs should be designed to meet the specific
needs and goals of the individual client. Furthermore, the initial
exercise program should reflect (a) the initial fitness level of the
client, (b) fitness assessment results, and (c) whether the client has
any significant risk factors or health limitations to exercise. Each
exercise training session should also include the following
phases:]{.mark}

- [Warm-up phase]{.mark}

- [Conditioning phase]{.mark}

- [Cool-down phase]{.mark}

[Cardiorespiratory Warm-Up Phase]{.underline}

[A warm-up is generally described as preparing the body for physical
activity. It can be either general in nature or more specific to the
activity. A general warm-up consists of movements that do not
necessarily have any movement specific to the actual activity to be
performed. Ex­amples of a general warm-up include walking on a treadmill
or riding a stationary bicycle before weight training. A specific
warm-up consists of movements that more closely mimic those of the
actual activity, often referred to as dynamic stretches.]{.mark}

+--------------------------+---------------------------------------+

[The cardiorespiratory portion of a warm-up period consists of
whole-body, dynamic cardi­orespiratory or muscular movements (well below
the anticipated training intensity threshold for conditioning). The
purpose of the warm-up period is to increase heart and respiration
rates, increase tissue temperature, and psychologically prepare the
individual for higher training in­tensities.]{.mark}

[Suggested warm-up activities]{.underline}

[NASM recommends that the cardiorespiratory portion of a warm-up last
between 5 and 10 min­utes and be performed at a low- to
moderate-intensity level. However, depending on the client's goals and
objectives, these recommendations can be modified by either extending or
reducing the time allotted to the warm-up period or by modifying
activities based on any known or sus­pected medical or physical
limitations a client may have.]{.mark}

[New clients who are sedentary or have medical limitations or those with
limited previous exercise experience may require more of their dedicated
workout time be directed to warm-up activities, at least
initially.]{.mark}

[Moreover, a comprehensive warm-up should also include a combination of
flexibility techniques in addition to cardiorespiratory exercise.
Flexibility exercises include self-myofascial techniques (i.e., foam
rolling), static stretching, active stretching, and dynamic
stretching.]{.mark}

[It is vitally important that fitness professionals have a comprehensive
understanding of safe and effective flexibility exercises. Fitness
professionals should begin each training session with new clients by
explaining the benefits to be gained from each new flexibility technique
followed by a demonstration of each new exercise, emphasizing safety and
proper technique. Once a client has demonstrated a complete
understanding of flexibility techniques and operation of the
cardiorespiratory equipment, they can begin performing the warm-up
before the session with the fitness professional. This will then allow
for increased training time in which to focus on other aspects of the
training program.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[Flexibility techniques used during a client's warm-up should target
muscles that have been identified as overactive during the assessment
process. Consequently, fitness professionals should conduct a
comprehensive fitness evaluation, including posture and movement
assessments, prior to designing a client's exercise program.]{.mark}

[It should be emphasized that the warm-up period should prepare the body
for activity; thus, it is important to monitor the intensity at which
clients are performing selected warm-up ac­tivities to ensure they do not
unduly fatigue before the workout portion of their program begins.
Keeping the activity to a moderate duration and intensity level will
help ensure a proper warm-up.]{.mark}

**Conditioning Phase**

[Individuals who engage in cardiorespiratory exercise likely do so for a
variety of reasons, includ­ing expending calories to lose weight,
reducing stress, or improving their health, or for a host of other
reasons. An important point that fitness professionals should share with
their clients is that low-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise will
typically result in some improvements in health and well-being but not
necessarily result in significant improvements in conditioning as
compared with higher-training intensities.]{.mark}

**Cool-down phase**

[A cool-down provides the body with a smooth transition from exercise
back to a steady state of rest. In essence, a cool-down is the opposite
of the warm-up. This portion of a workout is often overlooked and viewed
as less important than the other components. However, proper use of a
cool-down can have a significant impact on a client's overall response
to exercise. The overarching goal of a cool-down is to reduce heart and
breathing rates, gradually cool body temperature, return muscles to
their optimal resting lengths, prevent pooling of blood in the lower
extremities (which may cause dizziness or possible fainting), and
restore physiologic systems close to baseline. Sufficient time for a
cardiorespiratory cool-down period is approximately 5 to 10
minutes.]{.mark}

**Flexibility training during a cool-down period**

[Flexibility training should also be included in the cool-down period.
Flexibility training, includ­ing self-myofascial techniques and static
stretching, has been shown to be effective at managing muscle soreness
and promoting optimal joint range of motion.]{.mark}

[Initially, fitness professionals should closely monitor new clients
during both the warm-up and the cool-down periods to make certain that
the activities being performed are appropriate, safe, and effective. It
is also important for the client to understand the importance of both
the warm-up and the cool-down periods.]{.mark}

TRAINING TIP

[Regardless of the goal, always begin an exercise program with posture
and movement assessments, such as the overhead squat, pushing, pulling,
and single-leg squat tests. These assessments help determine the muscles
that need to be stretched during a warm-up. If a muscle is overactive,
it may be impeding or altering proper movement and as such needs to be
corrected to enhance movement.]{.mark}

1.  [When used in a warm-up, stretching techniques should only be used
    on areas that the assessments have determined are
    overactive.]{.mark}

2.  [During the cool-down, self-myofascial techniques and static
    stretching should be used to return muscles to normal resting
    lengths. Clients should focus on identified overactive muscles
    and/or the major muscles used during the workout.]{.mark}

**Stage training**

[Cardiorespiratory training, as with any other form of training, falls
under the principle of specificity. According to the principle of
specificity, the body will adapt to the level of stress placed on it and
will then require more or varied amounts of stress to produce a higher
level of adaptation in the future. For example, a client who begins
jogging for 30 minutes 5 days per week will, over time, become more
aerobically fit. Consequently, this individual will need to increase the
duration or intensity of each jogging session to experience continual
fitness im­provements. To accomplish this goal, cardiorespiratory
exercise programs should be tailored to the individual, using their own
unique metabolic markers (e.g., ventilatory threshold) as a guide for
proposing exercise intensities.]{.mark}

[The purpose of stage training is to ensure that cardiorespiratory
training programs progress in an organized fashion to ensure continual
adaptation and minimize the risk of overtraining and injury. The five
stages of cardiorespiratory training discussed in this section use
different inten­sities (training zones). Each of the four training zones
target a specific outcome while remaining customizable for clients. As a
result, stage training is appropriate for new exercis­ers, fitness
enthusiasts, and performance athletes.]{.mark}

+----------------+--------------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+

[Stage 1]{.underline}

[Cardiorespiratory exercise in stage 1 is beneficial for those new to
exercise who are seeking to improve health markers, such as reducing the
risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Stage 1 represents the
lowest intensities of exercise and is used to introduce individuals to
exercise and improve general health and fitness and is also used as a
recovery format following higher-intensity exercise sessions. Stage 1 is
designed to help improve cardiorespiratory fitness levels in apparently
healthy sedentary clients using a target intensity below ventilatory
threshold 1 (VT1) and involves steady-state aerobic exercise. In other
words, when using the talk-test method to monitor training intensity,
the client should be able to easily hold a conversation during the
duration of the activity. If using RPE to measure intensity, the client
should feel the exercise intensity as light to moderate. The exerciser
is starting to sweat, but they can still carry on a conversation
effortlessly.]{.mark}

[In stage 1, clients should start slowly and gradually work up to 30
minutes of continuous activity. Clients who can maintain a zone 1
intensity for at least 30 minutes three times per week will be ready for
stage 2. However, a deconditioned client might take 2 to 3 months to
meet this demand, depending on their current fitness level and how often
they exercise. Goals of stage 1 training are to help clients build an
appropriate aerobic base and foun­dational level of fitness. Moreover,
this stage may serve as a motivation tool to help clients ad­here to a
physically active lifestyle, because clients are more likely to continue
with an exercise program that is moderately difficult yet
achievable.]{.mark}

[As with any exercise program, rate of progression must be considered.
Stage 1 workouts can be progressed by gradually adding duration to each
exercise session. For example, a week 1 program may involve 15 minutes
of continuous aerobic exercise, 3 days per week. Each subsequent week an
additional few minutes can be added to each exercise session until the
client successfully manages 30 minutes of continuous exercise three
times per week. It is important not to exceed more than 10% of added
volume per week to avoid overtraining or burnout.]{.mark}

[Stage 2]{.underline}

[Stage 2 is designed for clients with intermediate cardiorespiratory
fitness levels who are ready and who desire to begin training at a
slightly higher intensity. The focus of stage 2 training is on
increasing the workload (e.g., speed, incline) in a way that helps
clients exercise at higher intensities and achieve greater levels of
aerobic fitness. Stage 2 is ideal for fitness enthusiasts who regularly
engage in physical activity or recreational sport or for those seeking
further improvements in cardiovascular endurance or weight loss.]{.mark}

[Prior to initiating a stage 2 workout, fitness professionals should
perform the talk test with their client to determine their client's
heart rate at VT1. Once identified, ideally this measurement would be
used to monitor exercise intensity throughout the duration of the stage
2 workout.]{.mark}

[Stage 2 is the introduction to aerobic interval training in which
intensities are varied throughout the workout. A stage 2 workout
consists of a mix of recovery intervals just below VT1 (or a score of
"moderate to challenging" when using RPE) and work intervals performed
at an intensity just above VT1 (or a score of "challenging to hard" when
using RPE). Interval training in this manner will likely improve both
physical fitness (e.g., increased VO2max) and health markers, such as
reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.]{.mark}

[For example, if a client's heart rate at VT1 is 145 bpm, they should
perform exercise intervals slightly above 145 bpm and recovery intervals
just below 145 bpm. However, using RPE to gauge exercise intensity is an
effective alternative if a heart rate monitor is not available.]{.mark}

[Stage 2 work intervals should start out relatively brief (e.g., 30--60
seconds) and progress in duration and intensity over time. Work-to-rest
ratios of 1:3, 1:2, and 1:1 are appropriate for stage 2 training. For
example, a 1:3 work-to-rest ratio involving a 1-minute interval just
above VT1 would include 3 minutes of recovery below VT1. The duration
and intensity of intervals should be gradually increased as the client's
fitness levels improve. For example, a 1-minute work interval can be
increased to 2 or 3 minutes. In addition, work-to-rest ratios should
progress in difficulty from 1:3 to 1:2 to eventually 1:1. These
progressions should be based on the ability and willingness of the
client to perform higher-intensity exercise.]{.mark}

Example stage 2 aerobic interval program: [Stage 2 exercise programs
should be individualized and tailored to meet the needs and goals of the
client. Following is one example of a stage 2 cardiorespiratory
program:]{.mark}

1.  [Start by warming up for 5--10 minutes.]{.mark}

2.  [Move into a 1-minute interval in zone 2 that is just above
    VT1.]{.mark}

3.  [After the 1-minute interval, return to zone 1 for 3
    minutes.]{.mark}

4.  [Repeat these intervals until the duration of the exercise session
    is complete.]{.mark}

5.  [Cool down for 5--10 minutes.]{.mark}

[For clients new to interval training, it is a good idea to alternate
stage 1 and stage 2 workouts. For example, start with stage 1 on Monday,
then move to stage 2 on Wednesday, and go back to stage 1 on Friday. The
next week, start with stage 2 and so on. Rotate the stages to keep
workouts balanced. This will become very important in stage 3. However,
this plan is only a general guide and may be changed based on the
client's training schedule, available recovery time, and unfore­seen
external stressors, such as lack of sleep.]{.mark}

[Stage 2 steady-state aerobic exercise]{.underline}

[Once clients become accustomed to stage 2 intervals and have shown
positive signs of adapting to the physical demands, they can begin
performing moderately intense steady-state cardio exercise above VT1, if
desired. In other words, the client can perform aerobic conditioning in
zone 2 just above VT1 for the duration of the exercise session without
the use of intervals. It is important to note that stage 2 steady-state
aerobic exercise is not a requirement, but rather an option for clients
who prefer to perform steady-state aerobic exercise instead of
intervals. Mod­erately intense aerobic activity has been proven effective
for individuals seeking improvements in fitness and cardiovascular
health.]{.mark}

[An example stage 2 steady-state workout can proceed as follows:]{.mark}

1.  [Start by warming up for 5--10 minutes in zone 1.]{.mark}

2.  [Increase intensity (e.g., speed, incline) until client reaches zone
    2, which is just above VT1.]{.mark}

3.  [Continue the duration of the exercise session at this
    intensity.]{.mark}

4.  [Cool down in zone 1 for 5--10 minutes.]{.mark}

[CRITICAL]{.mark}

[For most weight-loss clients and those new to exercise, stages 1 and 2
are most appropriate and effective for improving health and wellness and
promoting a healthy body weight. These two stages should be top priority
for the average exerciser and gym goer.]{.mark}

[Stages 3 through 5 are most appropriate for athletes and advanced
fitness enthusiasts who are seeking greater improvements in
cardiorespiratory conditioning and are willing to participate in
high-intensity exercise. It is not necessary for fitness professionals
to implement all five stages with their clients. Cardiorespiratory
exercise should be individualized based on the client's needs, goals,
abilities, and exercise preferences.]{.mark}

[Stage 3]{.underline}

[Stage 3 is for the moderately advanced client who has obtained a
satisfactory cardiorespiratory fitness base. Stage 3 training increases
the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic energy systems and is applicable
for clients seeking further improvements in exercise capacity. Research
demon­strates that high-intensity interval training is a time-efficient
strategy to increase physical fitness.]{.mark}

[However, stage 3 is not appropriate for all clients. Clients seeking
only modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, those who are new
to exercise, and individuals who are averse to high-intensity training
can skip stage 3 training.]{.mark}

[To accurately program stage 3 intervals, measurements of VT1 and VT2
need to be recorded. Recall, at VT1, talking becomes challenging but not
difficult for the client during aerobic activity, whereas VT2
corresponds with an individual's inability to speak more than a word or
two during.]{.mark}

[For example, if a client's heart rate at VT1 is 145 bpm and their heart
rate at VT2 is 165 bpm, the four training zones are calculated as
follows:]{.mark}

- [Zone 1: Less than 145 bpm]{.mark}

  [Zone 2: 145--154 bpm (VT1 to midpoint)]{.mark}

  [Zone 3: 155--164 bpm (midpoint to VT2)]{.mark}

  [Zone 4: 165 bpm and higher]{.mark}

[The midpoint refers to the intensity level halfway between VT1 and
VT2.]{.mark}

[A stage 3 program includes the client moving in and out of training
zones 1, 2, and 3, while always staying below zone 4. A general rule of
thumb is to have a modest mix of time spent in zone 1 (moderate
intensity) with brief interval periods in zones 2 (hard intensity) and 3
(vigorous, very hard intensity) to minimize overtraining while
simultaneously providing enough overload to challenge energy systems
needed for performance adaptations.]{.mark}

[Zone 2 and 3 intervals should be client specific based on the client's
goals, needs, and abilities, and zone 2 intervals are typically longer
than zone 3 intervals because zone 3 intervals are more intense and
physically demanding. Moreover, the volume of training in stage 3 should
be progressive, yet in a slow and gradual fashion.]{.mark}

Example stage 3 cardiorespiratory program[: Like stage 2, stage 3
exercise programs should be individualized for the client based on their
unique goals, needs, and abilities. Following is one example of a stage
3 program:]{.mark}

1.  [Warm up in zone 1 for up to 5--10 minutes.]{.mark}

2.  [Then, increase the workload every 60 seconds until reaching zone 3.
    This will require a climb through zone 2, which may take a couple of
    minutes.]{.mark}

3.  [After pushing for another minute in zone 3, decrease the workload
    back to zone 2.]{.mark}

4.  [Overload the body again by performing another zone 3
    interval.]{.mark}

5.  [Repeat for the desired number of intervals.]{.mark}

6.  [Cool down for 5--10 minutes.]{.mark}

[It is vital when training at this level to rotate all three stages.
There should be a low- (stage 1), medium- (stage 2), and high-intensity
(stage 3) day to help minimize the risk of overtraining. The stage 1 day
could be considered a recovery day following a hard stage 3 training
day.]{.mark}

[Work intervals within stage 3 should start out relatively brief,
perhaps lasting 30 to 60 seconds. Once fitness and overall conditioning
improve, stage 3 programs can be progressed similarly to stage 2
workouts, decreasing work-to-rest ratios and increasing the duration of
high-intensity intervals. However, the frequency and duration of
intervals in zones 2 and 3 should be client specific based on their
goals, needs, abilities, and tolerance to intense activity.]{.mark}

[Stage 4]{.underline}

[Stage 4 is for the advanced client who has obtained a high-level
cardiorespiratory fitness. Stage 4 training increases the capacity of
the anaerobic energy system and is applicable for high-level athletes
and fitness enthusiasts seeking improvements in anaerobic capacity and
power.]{.mark}

[Stage 4 is not appropriate for all clients, especially those with only
modest levels of physical fitness or those averse to high-intensity
conditioning. Consequently, stage 4 should be reserved for those seeking
improvement in maximal anaerobic performance, such as athletes and
top-end fitness competitors. Like stage 3, measurements of VT1 and VT2
need to be recorded to accu­rately program stage 4 intervals.]{.mark}

[A stage 4 workout includes the client moving in and out of all four
training zones. A general rule of thumb is to have most of the time
spent in zone 1, with brief interval periods in zones 2, 3, and 4 to
minimize overtraining while simultaneously providing enough overload to
challenge the anaerobic energy system. Furthermore, brief intervals in
zones 2, 3, and 4 ensure the client is working at maximum performance
rather than maximal effort.]{.mark}

[Intervals should be client specific based on the client's goals, needs,
and abilities. The volume of training in stage 4 should be slow and
gradual. If the client exhibits signs of overtraining, such as disturbed
sleep, excessive fatigue, impaired performance, loss of appetite, or
mood swings, volume and intensity of stage 4 workouts should be
decreased, and the client should be allowed more recovery time between
exercise sessions.]{.mark}

HELPFUL HINT

[Maximal performance refers to performing a task where a client or
athlete is performing at their absolute peak ability, and work intensity
is consistent across all intervals. For example, an athlete runs a
100-meter dash in an attempt to beat their best time. The athlete then
sufficiently rests to restore their energy stores (ATP) before
attempting another 100-meter dash. The athlete's goal is decreasing
their time in the 100-meter dash, which is a performance
initiative.]{.mark}

[Maximal effort refers to executing a task where effort is 100% but
performance may dwindle due to fatigue. For example, an athlete runs
repeated 100-meter dashes with only 30 seconds of rest between each
attempt. Consequently, the athlete's 100-meter times slow with each
attempt even though the athlete is giving 100% effort. This format
improves conditioning but may not be ideal for improving sprinting
performance.]{.mark}

Example stage 4 cardiorespiratory program: [Stage 4 exercise programs
involve high-intensity exercise and should be client specific. Following
is one example of implementing a stage 4 workout:]{.mark}

1.  [Warm up in zone 1 for up to 5--10 minutes.]{.mark}

2.  [Then, increase the workload every 60 seconds until reaching zone 4.
    This will require a climb through zones 2 and 3, which may take a
    couple of minutes.]{.mark}

3.  [Push for 10 seconds in zone 4 and then decrease the workload back
    to zone 1. This 1-minute break is an important minute to help gauge
    training status and improvement.]{.mark}

4.  [As improvements are made during several weeks of training, the
    client's heart rate will drop more quickly. The faster the client's
    heart rate drops, the more fit they are becoming.]{.mark}

5.  [If the client is not able to drop to the appropriate heart rate
    during the 1-minute break, assume that they are tired and about to
    overtrain. The solution is to stay in zone 1 for the remainder of
    the workout. The bottom line is that the client is not rested enough
    to do that type of exercise on that day (which may be because of a
    hard workout the day before, not enough sleep, or poor
    nutrition).]{.mark}

6.  [If the client's heart rate does drop to a normal rate, then
    overload the body again by performing another zone 4
    interval.]{.mark}

7.  [After this minute, go back to zone 1 for 5--10 minutes and repeat
    if desired.]{.mark}

[When training at this level, it is imperative to rotate all four
stages. There should be a low- (stage 1), medium- (stage 2),
high-intensity (stage 3), and maximal-intensity (stage 4) day to help
minimize the risk of overtraining.]{.mark}

[Zone 4 intervals within a stage 4 workout should be brief: 5 to 10
seconds. Once fitness and overall conditioning improve, stage 4 programs
can be progressed similarly to stage 2 and stage 3 workouts, decreasing
work-to-rest ratios and increasing the frequency of high-intensity
inter­vals. However, the frequency and duration of intervals should be
client specific based on their goals, needs, abilities, and tolerance to
intense activity.]{.mark}

[Stage 5]{.underline}

[Stage 5 consists of sport-specific training and is applicable for all
types of athletes. It focuses on drills that help improve conditioning
using linear, multidirectional, and sport-specific activities performed
as conditioning and often combines high-intensity interval training with
small-sided games and agility drills. This stage incorporates the
movements, skills, and drills that coaches often use in practice
sessions to apply a sport-related stimulus for metabolic benefits. The
timing of the drills, the amount of rest provided, and the length of the
session can progressively increase to more stressful, game-like sessions
as fitness improves and competition approaches.]{.mark}

[While ventilatory testing and heart rate monitoring are not required
during stage 5, the fitness professional can benefit from monitoring
heart rates or RPE during specific drills to get a picture of the
relative intensity of the session. Although consistent aerobic exercise
is important for optimal sport preparation, caution is warranted to
avoid excessive training volume at the highest intensities. Similar to
stage 4 training, volume should be kept at a minimum to avoid
overtraining, especially when exercise sessions involve maximal effort.
Regular recovery and hydration periods should be included to ensure an
optimal training response.]{.mark}

# **Postural considerations in cardiorespiratory training**

[When prescribing cardiorespiratory training, it is important to
continuously assess the client's posture during movement. Whether the
client is exhibiting poor posture while standing or in motion, it is the
fitness professional's responsibility to correct postural alignment to
minimize injury risk and maximize performance. Common postural
deviations that clients may exhibit while engaging in cardiorespiratory
training include the following:]{.mark}

- [Forward head and rounded shoulders]{.mark}

  [Anterior pelvic tilt]{.mark}

  [Adducted and internally rotated knees and pronated feet]{.mark}

[To ensure movement quality during cardiorespiratory training, use the
following observa­tion techniques for clients who exhibit these postural
deviations.]{.mark}

[Rounded shoulders and forward head posture]{.underline}

[Rounded shoulders and a forward head posture may negatively affect
ventilation and oxygen delivery to muscle cells and, subsequently,
performance. The forward rounding of the shoulders theoretically limits
the ability to lift the ribcage during ventilation and forcefully
contract the diaphragm during inspiration. For clients exhibiting
symptoms from this posture during cardiorespiratory exercise, the
fitness professional must closely observe for the following postural
deviations:]{.mark}

1.  [During use of stationary bicycles, treadmills, and elliptical
    trainers, watch closely for rounding of shoulders forward and a
    protruding head and cue the client to retract their shoulders and
    head.]{.mark}

2.  [On steppers and treadmills, watch for the grasping of the handles
    (with an oversupinated or overpronated hand position), which may
    cause elevated and protracted shoulders and a forward head. If
    possible, this equipment should be used without the assistance of
    the hands to increase the demands on the core musculature, elevating
    the caloric expenditure and balance requirements of the
    exercise.]{.mark}

    cervical extension (looking upward) or rotation of the head to view
    the television.]{.mark}

[Anterior Pelvic Tilt]{.underline}

[An anterior pelvic tilt (arched lower back) may also negatively affect
ventilation, oxygen delivery to muscle cells, and performance similar to
clients exhibiting upper crossed syndrome. Moreover, an anteriorly
rotated pelvis and arched lower back may also result in low-back pain,
which can negatively impact exercise performance. The fitness
professional must closely observe the client for the following postural
deviations:]{.mark}

1.  [Initial use of bicycles or steppers may not be warranted, or should
    be minimized, because the hips are placed in a constant state of
    flexion, adding to what may already be an overactive hip flexor
    complex for many clients. If they are used, emphasize flexibility
    techniques for the hip flexors before and after use. Additional
    strengthening exercises for the core and gluteal complex are also
    recommended.]{.mark}

2.  [Treadmill speed should be kept to a controllable pace to avoid
    overstriding. The hips may not be able to properly extend and may
    cause the low-back to overextend (arch), placing increased stress on
    the low-back. Flexibility for the hip flexors should be emphasized
    before and after use, along with strengthening exercises for the
    core and gluteal complex.]{.mark}

[Adducted and Internally Rotated Knees and Pronated Feet]{.underline}

[Individuals with this posture must be careful not to exacerbate faulty
lower extremity move­ments, such as knee valgus (knock-knees). Knee
valgus is a predictive factor for knee injury. The fitness professional
must keep the following factors in mind:]{.mark}

1.  [Cardiorespiratory exercise that involves the lower extremities
    requires proper mobility at the ankle joint. Emphasize
    self-myofascial techniques and stretching for the calves, adductors,
    and hip flexors. Additional strengthening exercises for the gluteus
    medius and maximus are also recommended.]{.mark}

[Using the treadmill and steppers that require climbing may initially be
too extreme for constant repetition if clients are allowed to hold onto
the rails and speed up the pace. If these modalities are used, emphasize
the flexibility exercises mentioned previously and keep the pace at a
controllable speed until these postures are corrected.]{.mark}
