# Fats

[Fat is one of the three macronutrients of the human diet. Dietary fat
is important for our survival and has many important functions in our
bodies, such as being a major source of energy, metabolising fat-soluble
vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and obtaining essential fatty acids. Unlike
protein and carbohydrates, fat is hydrophobic and is not soluble in
water. In other words, water and oil do not mix, no matter how much you
shake or stir these two substances.]{.mark}

[Another difference between the macronutrients is that carbohydrates and
protein contain 4 kcals/gram (0.14 kcals/ounce), whereas fat contains 9
kcals/gram (0.32 kcals/ounce). The fact that fat has over twice as many
calories per gram than protein and carbohydrates has made it the
targeted nutrient for weight loss and reducing cardiovascular disease
(CVD). While overconsumption of the high-energy density of fat can lead
to weight problems and cardiovascular disease, consuming the recommended
amount of dietary fat, as well as eating heart-healthy fats and oils, is
important for promoting overall health and well-being.]{.mark}

## Structure of lipids

[Lipids consist of repeating units of fatty acids, which are comprised
of hydrogen, carbons, and oxygen. There are a number of types of lipids,
each important in various functions in the body. These include simple
lipids such as fatty acids, compound lipids such as phospholipids, and
derived lipids such as cholesterol.]{.mark}

**Simple lipids**

[Fatty acids are the building blocks of fats. They are comprised of long
hydrocarbon chains. At one end of the hydrocarbon chain is a carboxyl
group (COOH). This carboxyl group is what makes a fatty acid an acid
(carboxylic acid). Fatty acids are categorised into saturated fatty
acids or unsaturated fatty acids.]{.mark}

[Have you ever kept a cube of butter on the counter (at room
temperature) for a few hours? When you come back it is still a cube
shape, not melted.]{.mark}

[Saturated fatty acids have single bonds between the carbon atoms and
are saturated with hydrogen atoms. It is the hydrogenation of the carbon
atoms that makes these fats stable, giving them a long shelf life.
Saturated fats, such as butter, are usually solid or semi-solid at room
temperature. Saturated fatty acids are found mostly in animal products:
cheese, beef, pork, chicken, butter, full fat dairy and egg yolks. There
are also a few unique plant sources of saturated fatty acids such as
chocolate and cocoa butter, coconut, and palm kernel oils. See Table:
Examples of Foods Containing Saturated Fats for examples of foods high
in saturated fat.]{.mark}

[Unsaturated fatty acids contain one (monounsaturated) or more
(polyunsaturated) double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated
fatty acids are normally liquid at room temperature, found primarily in
plant sources, and are relatively unstable. This instability makes
unsaturated fatty acids more prone to oxidative damage compared to
saturated fatty acids, which gives them a shorter shelf life.
Unsaturated fatty acids can be categorised into monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).]{.mark}

[Foods that are excellent sources of MUFAs include olive oil; nuts such
as almonds, cashews, and pecans; canola oil; avocados; olives; and nut
butters like peanut or almond butter, for example. MUFAs are an
important part of a heart-healthy diet, such as with the Mediterranean
diet, for example. Polyunsaturated fats are also a central part of a
heart-healthy diet.]{.mark}

[Good sources of PUFAs include walnuts, sunflower seeds, flax oil, or
salmon and corn, soybean, and safflower oil. Research has shown that
substituting these fats for saturated or trans fats or refined
carbohydrates can significantly decrease a person's risk of
cardiovascular disease. Another fatty acid category is trans fat or
trans-fatty acid. Trans fat is the resulting fat from taking an oil and
forcing hydrogen into it so it becomes saturated---an example of
hydrogenation. The primary source of trans fat is partially hydrogenated
oils (PHOs) such as margarine and vegetable shortening, as well as fried
foods such as French fries, doughnuts, fried chicken, baked goods,
snacks, and non-dairy coffee whitener. These fats adversely affect a
range of CVD risk factors, including raising low-density lipoproteins
(LDLs) and triglycerides, lowering high-density lipoproteins (HDL),
increasing inflammation, and promoting endothelial dysfunction.]{.mark}

[Most dietary fat is comprised of triglycerides. The chemical structure
of triglycerides is a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids. In
addition to triglycerides being the main chemical form for most fat in
the food supply, it is also the main component of adipose tissue (body
fat) in our bodies. This layer of fat under the skin insulates the body
from extreme temperature changes, acts as a cushion around our internal
organs to protect against mechanical trauma, and is storage for vitamins
A, D, E, and K.]{.mark}

[In addition, triglycerides are involved in the transportation of fats
in the bloodstream. Triglycerides get into our bloodstream in two ways:
they come directly from the fats or from the carbohydrates we
eat.]{.mark}

- [Prefixes. Mono-, di-, tri- and poly- mean *one*, *two*, *three* or
  *many,* respectively. Therefore, when you see *mono*unsaturated fatty
  acid, that means there is one fatty acid per glycerol. Triglycerides
  are three fatty acids per glycerol.]{.mark}

- [Fat is hydrophobic. Think *phobic*, which is defined as having an
  extreme fear or aversion to something. Fat has an aversion to
  water.]{.mark}

- [There are compound lipids that contain hydrophobic (hates water) and
  hydrophilic (loves water) components. This is necessary to be able to
  get along with all compounds, such as fat-soluble and water-soluble
  vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids when it comes to moving
  elements through the blood and into the cells.]{.mark}

- [Visualise what happens when you mix oil and vinegar. They separate
  because oil does not want to mix with vinegar. When making salad
  dressing, an emulsifier, such as mustard, mayonnaise, egg yolks, or
  honey, is used to bind the oil and the vinegar.]{.mark}

- [Saturated fat means there are the largest number of hydrogens per
  carbon and this makes the fat solid at room temperature. Think butter,
  cheese, or the fat around a piece of steak. Trans fat is taking oil
  and forcing hydrogen into it so it becomes saturated. Think
  shortening. Unsaturated fat means not every carbon has hydrogen. Think
  canola oil.]{.mark}

- [Suffixes. Whenever you see -ase, that means it is an enzyme, like
  lip*ase*. A word ending in -genesis means *the formation of*, like
  gluco*genesis*-- the creation of glucose. One ending in -lysis means
  *the breakdown of something*, like hydro*lysis*.]{.mark}

- [Lipoproteins are a lipid plus protein. Are you confused about what
  are the good lipoproteins and what are the bad ones? Try this. You
  want high HDLs. These remove cholesterol to the liver. Hello liver,
  goodbye cells. You want low LDLs. These lipoproteins bring cholesterol
  to cells. Leave us alone, LDLs.]{.mark}

- [How do you remember whether a food is low or high in a nutrient based
  on the percent DV? Give me five (5% or less) means a food is low in
  the nutrient. Think 20/20 vision for those foods that are high in a
  nutrient (20% or higher).]{.mark}

**Compound lipids**

[The compound lipids include phospholipids and lipoproteins. A
phospholipid is a compound lipid, meaning it is composed of at least two
separate components. Phospholipids contain two fatty acids, a phosphate
group and a glycerol molecule. They are the main component of the cell
membrane. The phosphate group head and glycerol are water soluble
(hydrophilic); this means these elements do not repel water but rather
mix with it. Other substances that are water soluble include salt,
sugar, alcohol, and water-soluble vitamins. The fatty acid tail is
water-insoluble or hydrophobic.]{.mark}

[Lipoproteins are particles in the blood comprised of proteins,
phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesterol. Lipoproteins transport
triglycerides and cholesterol to and from the tissues of the body,
particularly between the liver and adipose tissue.]{.mark}

**Derived lipids**

[Cholesterol helps in the production of steroid hormones as well as
vitamin D. Some cholesterol is obtained from foods like eggs, cheese,
and shellfish; however, most cholesterol is produced by the
liver.]{.mark}

## Functions of lipids

[Dietary fat is necessary as a source of essential fatty acids and
fat-soluble vitamins. Within the body, fat has some very specific
functions; being an integral part of cell membranes provides insulation
and temperature regulation and is a major storage form of energy in the
body.]{.mark}

### Function of dietary fats

[From a nutritional standpoint, dietary fats are necessary as a source
of energy and to obtain the essential fatty acids, Omega-3s
(a-Linolenic) and Omega-6s (a-Linoleic), as well as to metabolise
fat-soluble vitamins.]{.mark}

**Fats as major source of energy**

[As mentioned before, dietary fat is the most concentrated source of
energy at 9 kcals/gram, which is more than two times the number of
calories in carbohydrates and protein at 4 kcals/gm. The majority of
excess fat intake is stored as triglycerides. While carbohydrates are
the body's preferred fuel source during physical activity, the body's
system turns to fat stored in the adipose tissue when carbohydrates are
not available.]{.mark}

**Fats as source of essential fatty acids**

[Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids are PUFAs. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)
is mostly found in plant oils such as walnuts, flaxseeds and flaxseed
oil, and chia seeds. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) omega-3 fatty acids are found in cold-water fatty fish and
shellfish such as salmon, mackerel, and crab. EPA and DHA are more
biologically active than ALA, and, therefore, are more important for
health. For instance, omega-3s, particularly EPA and DHA from fish and
shellfish, may help decrease the risk of developing CVD, heart failure,
coronary disease, and experiencing a fatal coronary heart disease.
However, more research is needed to fully substantiate these
claims.]{.mark}

[The anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s may be beneficial for
those who have rheumatoid arthritis. They are also imperative in the
development of eye and brain development in a growing foetus, especially
in the late stages of pregnancy. In addition, there is some evidence
that eating high levels of omega-3s may lower levels of depression, as
well as research suggesting that omega-3s may be protective against
Alzheimer's disease and dementia.]{.mark}

[The other essential fatty acid the body does not produce is omega-6
fatty acid (or linoleic acid). The primary sources of omega-6 fatty
acids are plant oils, including soybean, safflower, and canola, as well
as nuts and seeds, including pecans, walnuts, sesame seeds, and
sunflower seeds. Replacing saturated fats found in meats and dairy
products with these plant-based foods containing omega-6 fatty acids can
be beneficial for heart health. However, the issue is that most of the
general public\'s omega-6 intake comes from processed foods, such as
chips, crackers, and pastries. It is important for nutrition coaches to
emphasise healthier sources for omega-6 fats such as nuts, seeds, and
plant oils versus processed chips, crackers, or pastries, which are
typically energy dense (lots of calories), high in sugar or salt, and
provide little nutritive value.]{.mark}

### Dietary essential fatty acid recommendations

[Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) have been established for the
essential fatty acids linolenic (omega-3s) and linoleic
(omega-6s).]{.mark}

[The adequate intake (AI) for omega-3 fatty acid is 1.6 grams and 1.1
grams per day for males and females (ages 14 to 51+ years),
respectively. Consumption of EPA and DHA from food contributes a very
small amount (about 40 milligrams daily or 0.04 grams / 0.0014 ounces)
to total daily omega-3 intake. It is not difficult to meet this
recommendation if the right foods are chosen. Yet, omega-3 supplements,
comprised of usually fish oils, can be used to meet the RDIs. In fact,
omega-3 supplements were the most popular supplements compared to other
natural products such as probiotics, ginseng, and glucosamine, with 7.8%
of U.S. adults using an omega-3 supplement in 2012.]{.mark}

[Should women, while pregnant, eat fish to get their omega-3s? The
answer is yes. The recommendation is that pregnant women eat at least 8-
to 12-ounces of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. Mercury is
a metal that has been found to cause birth defects. Examples of seafood
with high mercury levels are: shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and
tilefish. The good news is the seafood that is high in DHA and EPA, like
salmon, herring, trout, and mackerel are low in mercury. A couple more
tips for pregnant women is to avoid uncooked fish or shellfish, and cook
seafood properly.]{.mark}

[For omega-6s, the AI is 17 grams for men and 12 grams for women.
Because omega-6 food sources are readily available, such as plant oils,
including soybean, safflower, and canola, it is easy to meet the dietary
recommendations. In addition, a number of processed foods have large
amounts of omega-6s in them. A cup of corn chips has 14.5 grams.
Regular-flavored microwave popcorn popped in oil has 22.3 grams and hard
peanut granola bars contain 12.0 grams of omega-6 fatty acids.]{.mark}

[How do vegans get EPA or DHA in their diet? While foods like chia and
flax seeds have large amounts of ALA, they do not have the more
biologically active versions of omega-3s: EPA and DHA. In fact, the
conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is quite small (\<5%). There is
evidence that seaweed is a good source of DHA, with one ounce of wakame
seaweed containing 52 milligrams (0.05 grams) of DHA.]{.mark}

[Be careful when searching for those foods high in omega-6 fatty acids.
Often, these foods are in milligrams and need to be converted to grams
by dividing by 1000. Good sources of omega-6s can be found in flaxseed
oil and seeds, hemp seeds, acai, and nuts, including pecans, walnuts,
sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds (Table: Selected Food Sources of
Omega-6s).]{.mark}

[It has been argued that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in
the Westernised diet may be involved in some chronic disease processes.
Some anthropologic data suggest that tens of thousands of years ago,
when humans were hunters and gatherers, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3
was about 1. However, this is based on limited data of selective groups.
Today, with traditional Western diets, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3
fatty acids is closer to 15/1 and sometimes higher. The excessive intake
of omega-6s and the very-high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio may increase the
risk of many diseases such as CVD, cancer, and inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. Currently, this is a hypothesis and something to
consider, but more research is needed to determine the most beneficial
ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFAs.]{.mark}

**Fats metabolise fat-soluble vitamins**

[The fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K, use fat to
be absorbed and stored within the body. These essential vitamins are a
vital part of the daily diet. Therefore, since fat-soluble vitamins are
hydrophobic (do not like water) consuming sufficient amounts of dietary
fat is necessary. In addition, fat is required to support the absorption
of these vitamins in the small intestine. Finally, fat-soluble vitamins
are stored in the liver or adipose tissue until they are needed by the
body.]{.mark}

### Function of fat within the body

[Beside the roles of dietary fat, body fat is important for a number of
reasons, including the body's cell membrane structure and function, as
well as insulation and temperature regulation.]{.mark}

**Cell membrane structure and function**

[Cells are encircled by a membrane. This membrane is responsible for
protecting the inside of the cell and for selective permeability.
Phospholipids are the main component of the cell's membrane. These
phospholipids are arranged in a phospholipid bilayer, which has the
hydrophilic (water-loving) heads pointing outwards and their hydrophobic
(water-repelling) fatty acid tails inward.]{.mark}

## Digestion and absorption

[While most dietary fat is consumed and stored within the body in the
form of triglycerides, these fats must be broken down into component
parts by the process of digestion, transported into the bloodstream by
the process of absorption, and delivered to the cells to either be used
as energy or rebuilt into triglycerides and stored in adipocytes in the
adipose tissue.]{.mark}

### The mouth and stomach

[The first step to digestion of triglycerides begins in the mouth when
fats encounter saliva. The chewing of food combined with a small amount
of phospholipids, which act as an emulsifier, allow the digestive
enzymes to work. The enzyme lingual lipase breaks down the
triglycerides, separating fat from the water-soluble components of food,
such as protein and carbohydrates. After swallowing, the fat moves to
the stomach where gastric lipase begins breaking down triglycerides into
diglycerides and free fatty acids. The stomach contracts and churns,
further separating the fat molecules before they enter the small
intestine. Note that minimal digestion of fat occurs in the mouth and
stomach as compared to the small intestine.]{.mark}

[Enzymes are an integral part of the digestion process. Enzymes are
proteins that speed up biochemical reactions in the body. For lipid
digestion, enzymes help break down triglycerides into glycerol and fatty
acids. Enzymes are identified by the suffix -ase. For instance, the
first enzyme involved in digestion is the enzyme lingual lipase, which
is secreted in the mouth.]{.mark}

### The small intestine

[In the small intestine, a small amount of bile, an emulsifier, is
released, which attracts fat molecules and holds onto them while being
held by the water. Next, pancreatic lipases break down triglycerides
into monoglycerides and free fatty acids.]{.mark}

[For absorption to occur, the bile salts surround the monoglycerides and
free fatty acids to form micelles. Inside of the micelle are products of
lipid digestion and fat-soluble vitamins (all the water-phobic
substances). On the outside of the micelle is a water-soluble lining,
allowing it to travel through the bloodstream. The micelles go to the
absorptive surface of the intestinal cells and release the
monoglycerides, fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins into the digestive
tract lining.]{.mark}

## Transport and storage of lipids

[Just as lipids require special handling for digestion and absorption to
occur, fats need the same kind of treatment when it comes to travelling
through the bloodstream. Since fats are hydrophobic and the blood is
approximately 92% water, fats (fatty acids) need a way to be transported
through the blood. In other words, lipids need some way to move from the
small intestine through the bloodstream to the cells of the body to be
used for energy or to be stored.]{.mark}

### Transport of lipids

[Once monoglycerides, fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins are released
into the digestive tract lining of the small intestine, the
monoglycerides and free fatty acids reassemble themselves into
triglycerides. Triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids, plus a
protein carrier, form a lipoprotein. This large lipoprotein, called a
chylomicron, enters the lymphatic system and moves toward a large vein
that drains into the heart. The chylomicrons (from digestion) and
very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) both move through the bloodstream
to deliver triglycerides to the cells of the body. Chylomicrons and
VLDLs get triglycerides into the cells with the help of lipoprotein
lipase, an enzyme found in the endothelium of the cells. The lipoprotein
lipase binds the chylomicrons and VLDLs and triglycerides are released
into the cells. Once in the cell, the lipoprotein lipase breaks down the
triglycerides into fatty acids and a glycerol for the cell to
use.]{.mark}

**The liver**

[Besides chylomicrons and VLDLs, there are two other important
lipoproteins: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL). As mentioned, both chylomicrons and VLDLs bring triglycerides to
the cells in the body. However, LDLs and HDLs carry cholesterol (not
triglycerides). Back at the liver, the VLDLs are stripped of their
triglycerides, which makes them denser. VLDL is stripped and turns into
LDL, which delivers cholesterol to the cells, which are modified and
transformed into HDLs.]{.mark}

[The function of LDL is to deliver cholesterol *to* the cells, where it
can be used in cell membranes or to help in the synthesis of steroid
hormones. On the other hand, HDL is responsible for retrieving excess
cholesterol from the cells and bringing it *back* to the liver. Excess
cholesterol is eliminated by the liver, which secretes the cholesterol
in bile (which can begin the whole process again of fat digestion and
absorption in the small intestine).]{.mark}

[Healthy cholesterol levels are important for improving overall
cardiovascular health and minimising the risk of a heart attack or
stroke. Table: Recommended Cholesterol Levels contains recommendations
for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and
triglycerides from various sources.]{.mark}

### Fat metabolism and storage

[To recount, chylomicrons and VLDLs deliver triglycerides to the cells,
which, once in the cell, are broken down to fatty acids and glycerol for
the cells to use. In adipose (fat) cells, the fatty acids are combined
with a glycerol to become a triglyceride for storage in the adipose
tissue. Once in the cell, the triglycerides go through beta-oxidation
within the cells where the byproducts are glycerol and free fatty acids.
However, in other cell types, particularly muscle cells, the fatty acids
may be stored or made into acetyl-CoA. In the liver, acetyl-CoA is
broken down into ketone bodies when rates of fatty oxidation are very
high. In addition, the liver converts glycerol into glucose via
gluconeogenesis.]{.mark}

[In recent decades, we have gained a greater understanding of the
importance of consuming an adequate amount of dietary fat (between 20%
and 35%) and the benefits of consuming plant-based unsaturated fats for
the reduction of CVD risk. In fact, the latest research supports the use
of higher-fat diets (such as the Mediterranean-style diet) to lose
weight and reduce CVD risk. Bottom line is to follow this
advice:]{.mark}

- [Avoid trans fats. These fats adversely affect a range of CVD risk
  factors, including raising LDLs and triglycerides, lowering HDLs,
  increasing inflammation, and promoting endothelial
  dysfunction.]{.mark}

- [Consume 10% or less of dietary calories from saturated fat. Replace
  saturated fats with PUFAs.]{.mark}

- [Focus on consuming PUFAs, including omega-3s and omega-6s food
  sources. Dietary PUFAs may lower serum VLDL and LDL concentrations.
  This is because the liver converts PUFAs into ketone bodies instead of
  VLDLs, which transport triglycerides to the cells.]{.mark}

- [Reduce refined carbohydrates and added sugars.]{.mark}

- [Reduce saturated fats and replace them with unsaturated fats]{.mark}
