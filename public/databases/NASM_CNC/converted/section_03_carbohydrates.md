# Carbohydrates

[Carbohydrates are often referred to as sugars and starches, or as
simple and complex carbohydrates. Examples of starches include grains,
corn, rice, barley, vegetables, beans, and wheat, whereas examples of
sugars include sweets (candy), sugar (cane sugar), fruit, and milk.
Except for lactose (milk sugar) and glycogen (the storage form of
carbohydrates in the body), all carbohydrates are plant-derived.
Collectively, they are considered the body's primary fuel source, yet
are often labelled as the cause of weight gain. Carbohydrates frequently
take a back seat to protein following exercise by those who fail to
recognise the importance of this nutrient. Blame for these belief
systems can be attributed to misinformation or even
misunderstandings.]{.mark}

[Although carbohydrates are not considered essential for survival,
considering how the body can synthesise the amounts of glucose needed to
survive from non-carbohydrate sources, they are generally needed in
specific quantities to optimise health and performance. Subsequently, it
is important for nutrition coaches to understand the importance of
carbohydrates and how they function within the body.]{.mark}

## Carbohydrate structure

[Although the terms starches and sugars may resonate with the public,
practitioners often refer to carbohydrates by their scientific
classifications: monosaccharides or single sugar units, disaccharides or
paired sugar units, and polysaccharides, which represent longer sugar
unit chains. It is the monosaccharides and disaccharides that are
collectively known as simple sugars to many.]{.mark}

[A smaller subgroup, called oligosaccharides, also exists, containing 3
to 10 sugar units. Polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are known as
complex carbohydrates. As humans, we consume all these different forms
of carbohydrates. However, our digestive process breaks down our
digestible complex carbohydrates to their building blocks: the
monosaccharides that are then absorbed into the body. Once absorbed,
carbohydrates can be used immediately as a source of fuel or can be
stored as glycogen in specific cells. In fact, the largest storage
depots for carbohydrates (glycogen) are the muscle and liver
cells.]{.mark}

### Monosaccharides

[This group of carbohydrates represents single-sugar units and the only
absorbable form of carbohydrates. Glucose (sometimes also referred to as
dextrin or dextrose), fructose, and galactose represent the three
nutritionally important monosaccharides to humans. They are each
composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Subsequently, they are called
hydrocarbons and they have the same molecular structure of C6H12O6.
Although assembled with the same number of elements, the orientation of
these elements within the molecule renders them uniquely different.
Notice the difference in the molecular structure of fructose in
comparison to glucose and galactose, which are both similar. This
difference helps explain why fructose and glucose are absorbed and
function differently in the body. While glucose and fructose are found
in many food sources, galactose is only present in dairy products,
forming part of the milk-sugar lactose.]{.mark}

[d for Thought]{.mark}

[Carbohydrates contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Hydrogen and oxygen form water (H2O), hence the term *hydrate*, which
then combines with the carbon atoms (or, if viewed differently, the
water molecule hydrates the carbon).]{.mark}

### Disaccharides

[Like monosaccharides, disaccharides are also categorised as simple
sugars. However, disaccharides are comprised of three nutritionally
important molecules: sucrose, lactose, and maltose.]{.mark}

- [Sucrose is comprised of one glucose molecule joined with one fructose
  molecule. Examples include cane sugar, brown sugar, and date sugar.
  Sucrose contributes as a primary sugar in most fruits.]{.mark}

- [Lactose is comprised of one glucose molecule joined with one
  galactose molecule. It is only found in dairy products.]{.mark}

- [Maltose is comprised of two glucose molecules. Examples include corn
  syrup, brown rice syrup, and black treacle]{.mark}

**Added sugars**

[Naturally occurring sugars, such as those found in fruit or milk, are
generally considered healthier options because the foods that contain
natural sugars also include other important nutrients like vitamins and
fibre. Added sugars are those not naturally occurring in food groups and
include syrups and other caloric sweeteners found in sweets and
sweetened beverages (soft drinks). Added sugars are sugars that are
added to foods or food products, not sugars that are naturally contained
in the food.]{.mark}

[Added sugars include regular (cane) sugar, brown sugar, coconut nectar,
date sugar, turbinado, raw sugar cane, and many other aliases for sugar
itself. All added sugars, regardless of their source, are either
monosaccharides or disaccharides that contain glucose, fructose, or
galactose.]{.mark}

[Elevated levels of insulin in circulation may desensitise the body's
insulin receptors embedded within the membranes of a cell. This can
advance the likelihood of developing insulin resistance, which reduces
the body's effectiveness of moving glucose out of the blood and into
cells. In turn, this might increase the potential for moving toward the
onset of conditions that lead to diabetes and prediabetes (early-stage
diabetes). Effective ways to preserve insulin sensitivity include
managing sugar and total carbohydrate intakes and remaining physically
active. A regular regimen of activity helps resensitise these insulin
receptors.]{.mark}

### Oligosaccharides

[This small and less-frequently discussed group of polymer saccharides
falls under the label of complex carbohydrates, but generally contains
between only 3 and 10 sugar units. These partially-digestible polymers
are found in legumes (e.g., peas, lentils, or beans) and plant sources;
contain glucose, fructose, and/or galactose; and are touted for
health-promoting benefits. Oligosaccharides are largely resistant to
digestion because the human digestive tract lacks the necessary enzymes
that can chemically break down many of these structures. This allows
them to pass to the large intestine where intestinal bacteria act on
them.]{.mark}

[In fact, certain enzymes derived from intestinal bacteria may produce
oligosaccharides from ingested starches and sugars. They essentially
serve as food for our large intestinal bacteria and are also referred to
as prebiotics. This category includes fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS),
galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and inulin, which is extracted from
chicory root. Sources of FOS include Jerusalem artichoke, leeks, onions,
and asparagus, while examples of GOS are soybeans and human breast milk,
which can support a healthy immune system in infants. Raffinose,
stachyose, and verbascose, all found in beans, peas, and other vegetable
sources, contain these three monosaccharides in the chemical
structure.]{.mark}

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Polysaccharides

[Polysaccharides are also complex carbohydrates and comprise starches,
fibres and glycogen. Each contain long-chain glucose structures of more
than 10 units, but they can be as large as several thousand units (e.g.,
glycogen molecule). Polysaccharide chains are arranged as straight-chain
structures called amylose, branched-chain structures called amylopectin,
and as a block structure called fibre. Both amylose and amylopectin are
digestible and make up approximately 20% and 80% of the digestible
starches found in vegetables, grains, pasta, rice, and beans,
respectively. Because enzymes digest from open ends of a structure,
amylopectin will digest to the absorbable monosaccharide form of glucose
faster than amylose. This raises the question to the implications of
complex carbohydrates containing more amylopectin versus
amylose.]{.mark}

[Greater levels of amylopectin result in a faster and a greater spike in
blood sugar than a similar compound with more amylose. Not only does
this have repercussions with respect to changes in blood sugar, but it
explains why not all complex carbohydrates rate low on the glycaemic
index (GI). Interestingly, because fibre has no open ends, it cannot be
digested in the human intestine by digestive enzymes.]{.mark}

**Fibre**

[Although fibre represents most of the indigestible portions of plant
food, it is not a single compound. It is a group of compounds that share
similar characteristics and are generally classified as either soluble
or insoluble. Examples of soluble fibre include pectins, gums and
mucilages that originate from the inside of the plant cell. They are
called soluble because they either dissolve or swell when placed in
water and most can be digested by the bacteria living within the large
intestine. Therefore, they are also sometimes called
fermentable.]{.mark}

[Soluble fibres are found in oat bran, oatmeal, beans, fruits (e.g.,
apples or pears) and vegetables (e.g., artichoke, leeks, or sweet
potatoes), as well as in many commercial products like salad dressings,
jams, and jellies. They offer several benefits that include the
following:]{.mark}

- [Weight loss --- It can delay gastric emptying (from the stomach) and
  it promotes an overall feeling of fullness, thereby potentially
  reducing caloric intake.]{.mark}

- [Reducing risk for cardiovascular disease --- It can bind to
  cholesterol particles. It can prevent its absorption and help remove
  this compound from the body.]{.mark}

- [Bowel movement and intestinal health --- It attracts water and it
  promotes bulk to the stool, which can safeguard against
  constipation.]{.mark}

- [Diabetes protection --- This carbohydrate is not absorbed. It can,
  therefore, reduce potential blood sugar spikes.]{.mark}

- [Improved absorption of foods --- It slows the movement of food
  through the small intestine. It can enhance nutrient
  absorption.]{.mark}

[Insoluble fibre (water insoluble) forms the structural parts of plants
and include compounds like cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and is
often found in the outermost portion of grains, vegetables, fruits and
seeds (e.g. whole-grain wheat, celery, brown rice, quinoa, apple peels
or broccoli). They are called insoluble or non-fermentable because they
do not dissolve in water and are not easily digested by intestinal
bacteria. When many of these compounds have their outermost portions
removed, this is what produces a processed starch (e.g., whole-wheat
kernel to white bread or brown rice to white rice).]{.mark}

[Like the soluble fibres, insoluble fibre also provides many health
benefits that include the following:]{.mark}

- [Digestive health --- It adds bulk and draws water into the GI tract.
  It improves regularity in the large intestine to avoid constipation
  and other bowel-related health problems (e.g. haemorrhoids).]{.mark}

  [Reduces risk of cancer---It improves movement through the large
  intestine. It reduces the risk of colon cancer and other large
  intestinal diseases (e.g. diverticulosis).]{.mark}

  [Weight loss --- By delaying gastric emptying (from the stomach), it
  promotes an overall feeling of fullness, reducing caloric
  intake.]{.mark}

[If a food is listed as a good source of fibre, it may contain insoluble
fibre, soluble fibre, or both.]{.mark}

[In their natural growing state, whole grains consist of the entire
seed, known as a kernel. The kernel consists of three parts: the bran,
germ, and endosperm. The bran is the outermost layer of the kernel and
is designed to protect the kernel from the environment. It contains B
vitamins, antioxidants, and fibre. The germ is the embryo of the kernel
and contains B vitamins, minerals, some protein, and healthy fats. The
endosperm is the largest portion of the kernel. It contains starchy
carbohydrates, some protein, and small amounts of vitamins and minerals.
During most refining processes, the bran and germ are removed from the
kernel. As such, much of the fibre and nutrients are lost. Examples of
this process including removing the outer layer of a whole-grain kernel
to convert brown rice to white rice.]{.mark}

[Functional fibre is a compound derived from isolated, indigestible
carbohydrates to supposedly provide some of the physiological benefits
that naturally occurring fibres provide to humans. These commercially
available and man-made compounds like polydextrose and inulin are
popular in many foods, but whether they offer the same health-promoting
benefits as natural fibre remains to be determined.]{.mark}

**Glycogen**

[Glycogen is the storage molecule of glucose in animals, similar to how
starch is the storage form of carbohydrates in plants. It is a large
molecule with a pinwheel orientation centered around a protein core
(glycogenin), and it can range from 100 to over 30,000 glucose units. It
is important to note that there is no fructose in glycogen; only glucose
molecules are used to form glycogen. It has a highly branched structure,
which allows enzymes to rapidly break the molecule apart as needed
during glycogenolysis. The formation of glycogen (glycogenesis) occurs
under action of glycogen synthase, an enzyme that is most active
immediately after meals and after exercise.]{.mark}

[Although muscle tissue contains significantly more stored glycogen than
the liver, this glycogen is not available to help preserve blood glucose
during times when blood sugar levels decrease. This is because muscles
cells, unlike liver cells, lack a specific enzyme called glucose
6-phosphatase, which helps create a free glucose molecule from glucose
6-phosphate, a compound that is formed when stored glycogen is broken
down for energy.]{.mark}

[Carbohydrates are found in three distinct locations within the body. A
small amount of glucose located in the blood is needed for distribution
to all parts of the body (e.g., brain and central nervous system, which
both prefer glucose as a fuel). A moderate amount of glycogen is stored
in the liver, which is needed to preserve blood sugar. Lastly, large
quantities of glycogen are stored in muscle tissue, which serve to fuel
muscular work. What about the heart and other organs? An important
distinguishing factor between liver and muscle glycogen is the fact that
the liver is the only organ that can release glucose into the blood.
Once glycogen is formed in a muscle cell, it is trapped and cannot be
released into circulation. This concept has important implication in
normal metabolism, fasting states, and during exercise.]{.mark}

[Normal carbohydrate storage in muscle cells is approximately 15 grams
per kilogram (6.8 g/lb.) of muscle tissue. Considering how muscle
comprises approximately 30% of a woman\'s mass and close to 40% of a
man\'s mass, this averages somewhere between 250 and 600 grams (1,000 to
2,400 kcal) in muscle tissue. Liver cells store approximately 50 grams
per kilogram (22.7g/lb.) of tissue, and, considering how the liver
weighs approximately 1.5 to 2.5 kg, this totals about 75 to 125 grams
(300 to 500 kcal).]{.mark}

[By comparison, blood glucose stores are small, ranging between 3 to 5
grams in a small adult, to about 10 to 15 grams in a very-large male.
The average adult stores around 2,000 to 2,500 kcal, whereas an
endurance athlete can expand their storage capacity to over 3,000 kcal.
It is estimated that an average adult will burn about 100 kcal/mile (1.6
km); therefore, the amount of glycogen stores in the body would cover
about 20 miles (32 km).]{.mark}

### Summary of carbohydrate classifications

[Carbohydrates follow a sequential classification system derived from
the number of sugar units contained within the structure or chain.
Although humans may ingest a variety of different carbohydrates (e.g.,
starches and sugars), the digestive process breaks them down into their
individual building blocks (called monosaccharides), which represent the
only absorbable form of carbohydrates to the body.]{.mark}

### Carbohydrate roles within the body

[The primary role of dietary carbohydrates is to provide energy for the
body. Any excess carbohydrates not used for immediate energy production
can be stored as glycogen within the muscle and liver. Because the liver
is capable of releasing glucose into circulation, it helps regulate
blood glucose and insulin metabolism, which helps avoid or manage
diseases like diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Should there be
additional carbohydrates, it is possible for this excess (i.e. beyond
what the body can store as glycogen) to be converted to fats called
triglycerides. Given this effect, carbohydrates could play a minor role
in indirectly regulating some fat production. Furthermore, balanced
levels of glucose and insulin also assist with regulating circulating
levels of other hormones like testosterone and the thyroid
hormones.]{.mark}

"The presence of adequate amounts of carbohydrates can spare the body's
need to catabolise (break down) muscle tissue."

[The physiological pathway of fat metabolism involves a carbohydrate
by-product for complete metabolism. When insufficient quantities of this
specific carbohydrate byproduct exist, the partially degraded fat
fragments are converted to ketones and metabolized differently. In
situations of inadequate carbohydrates, the body can produce glucose
from certain non-carbohydrate sources, including specific amino acids
(via gluconeogenesis) that are almost exclusively derived from muscle
tissue. Therefore, the presence of adequate amounts of carbohydrates can
spare the body's need to catabolise (break down) muscle tissue. The body
can also make glucose from fatty acids, if needed, particularly when
consuming a high-fat, very-low carbohydrate diet. Remember, the brain
requires glucose to function and will ultimately do whatever is needed
to function; in this case, it makes glucose from non-glucose
sources.]{.mark}

[Lastly, as mentioned earlier, soluble and insoluble fibres provide many
health benefits ranging from enhanced rates of weight loss and reduced
cholesterol, to enhanced digestive health and reduced risks of
developing cancer.]{.mark}

**Carbohydrate digestion and absorption**

[Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth because of salivary amylase,
an enzyme released by the salivary glands. Salivary amylase starts the
digestive process by cleaving large-chain polysaccharides into smaller
segments. The physical process of chewing food and adding fluid volume
(i.e., saliva) to solid food facilitates digestion by increasing its
surface area. In simpler terms, an individual's own saliva along with
chewing helps break down carbohydrates. It also facilities the action of
swallowing food to pass it to the stomach. This small, rounded mass of
food that is swallowed is known as bolus.]{.mark}

[In the stomach, food mixes with gastric juices and the high acidity of
stomach contents continue the digestive process. However, on leaving the
stomach and entering the duodenum of the small intestine, this chyme is
neutralised by sodium bicarbonate released from the pancreas, so that
pancreatic amylase can continue the digestion of carbohydrates in the
jejunum.]{.mark}

[In the jejunum, the digestible carbohydrates are further broken down to
disaccharide and monosaccharide forms, which then move to the latter
portion of the small intestine, the ileum, where most carbohydrates
absorption occurs. While the monosaccharides are in their absorbable
form, the disaccharides still need to undergo further digestion to
single sugar units, which takes place within the brush border of the
intestinal wall. The walls of the small intestine contain many
finger-like projections called villi, each with even smaller projections
called microvilli that collectively increase the region's surface area
to enhance nutrient absorption. The absorptive cells within the brush
border release specific enzymes to digest any remaining disaccharides to
their monosaccharide form.]{.mark}

[Some individuals are lactose intolerant, implying that they are unable
to digest lactose, or milk sugar, due to a lactase deficiency or
insufficiency. Because of the body's inability to digest lactose, the
intestinal bacteria digest this carbohydrate, resulting in bloating,
diarrhoea, gas, nausea, and pain in the abdomen. A primary cause of
lactose intolerance is genetic inheritance. In some individuals, the
small intestine begins to make less lactase after infancy and continues
to decrease with age, a condition called lactase non-persistence.
Symptoms associated with this lactose intolerance may not begin until
later in childhood, the teenage years, or even until adulthood.
Individuals who are lactose intolerant can opt to avoid dairy products,
consume lactose-free dairy products, or take a tablet containing the
lactase enzyme before ingesting any dairy.]{.mark}

[Once all digestion is complete, the monosaccharides are then absorbed
by the absorptive cells into the intestinal wall. Glucose and galactose,
however, are absorbed via a different process than fructose. This
process results in glucose and galactose being absorbed into the body at
a faster rate than fructose.]{.mark}

[Once absorbed, all monosaccharides enter the hepatic portal vein for
transportation to the liver. Priority number one for carbohydrates is to
serve as an immediate fuel, so glucose or fructose can be used by the
liver or pass into circulation for delivery to any target cell. Because
galactose only contributes marginally to overall carbohydrate intake, it
will not be discussed. Glucose feeds directly into the energy pathways,
while only about 35 to 45% of the absorbed fructose is oxidised in the
energy pathways.]{.mark}

[When the immediate fuel needs are met, priority two for the surplus of
carbohydrates (i.e., glucose or fructose) is to replenish liver and
muscle glycogen. Glucose molecules combine to build larger glycogen
chains, whereas approximately 40 to 50% of the fructose taken into the
cell becomes converted to glucose for glycogen synthesis. Interestingly,
while the body's absorbed fructose is either oxidised or converted to
glucose, the balance is converted to either lactate (about 30%) or to
triglycerides (fats) (\<1%). While the conversion to triglycerides is
small, it has raised health concerns, especially with the liver. A
prevailing belief involving fructose accumulation in the liver is its
conversion to fat that becomes stored within this organ. A significant
collection of fats in the liver can damage liver cells, much like what
happens with the disease cirrhosis.]{.mark}

[This disease is called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a
condition demonstrating greater significance in inactive people who
consume large amounts of fructose (and overall energy) in their diet.
Fructose intakes need to be consumed in quantities over 100 grams (3.5
ounces) a day for there to be any measurable detriment to human health.
In juxtaposition to this, the average American consumes roughly 55 grams
(1.94 ounces) of fructose per day, so just under half of what is
considered a problematic intake. So, all the data points toward excess
energy intake, not fructose per se, are the leading cause of
NAFLD.]{.mark}

### Hormonal regulation of glucose

[Two primary hormones, insulin and glucagon, are responsible for
preserving blood glucose.]{.mark}

- [Insulin is a hormone released from the pancreas. Although insulin has
  many important physiological roles in the body with respect to
  carbohydrates, it serves to lower blood sugar levels and prevent
  hyperglycaemia by facilitating glucose uptake into the liver, muscle
  and fat cells (for lipogenesis or fat building). In other words,
  insulin escorts glucose in the blood to the liver, muscle, and fat
  cells. In the liver cell, it inhibits the release of glucose into
  circulation. In cells, it promotes glycogenesis and inhibits
  gluconeogenesis. It is also involved in amino acids and fatty acid
  uptake into cells.]{.mark}

- [Glucagon is a hormone also released from the pancreas. Its functions
  are essentially the opposite of insulin. It serves to raise blood
  sugar levels during periods of hypoglycaemia by facilitating glucose
  release from the liver into circulation. In other words, glucagon is
  the hormone responsible for telling the liver to release glucose into
  the bloodstream. It promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and
  it also inhibits lipogenesis.]{.mark}

**At rest**

[The mechanism by which insulin works to move glucose into a cell
involves a secondary messenger because insulin cannot physically enter a
cell. Insulin is protein based and cell membranes are fat-based,
essentially repelling anything that is water soluble, like protein.
Therefore, insulin, acting like a key, binds to specialised receptors,
acting like locks that are embedded within the cell membrane. This
hormone-receptor complex activates pathways inside the cell (i.e.,
secondary messengers) that open special channels to allow for the entry
of glucose into the cell. This functionality, however, is largely
dependent on the availability of adequate amounts of insulin and the
sensitivity of the receptors to recognise insulin.]{.mark}

[In a healthy body, glucose in circulation enters the pancreas and
stimulates those beta-cells to release insulin. Once in circulation,
insulin will push excess glucose into cells and restore normal blood
sugar levels. The liver (primarily) and kidneys collectively start to
absorb insulin out of circulation and break it down to stop blood sugar
levels from dropping too low. Anytime an individual enters states of
hypoglycaemia, glucagon is released from the pancreas and travels to the
liver, where it releases stored glycogen to restore normal blood sugar
levels.]{.mark}

[Insulin production is dependent on the biological status of those
beta-cells in the pancreas. In some individuals, these cells may stop
producing insulin, perhaps due to some genetic variant or an autoimmune
response. In this case, the individual relies on exogenous insulin from
a pump or injection, and is diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin's
ability to function at the cellular level depends on the receptors
ability to recognise the hormone (i.e., receptor sensitivity). A
physically inactive lifestyle, coupled with overconsumption of energy
(e.g., too many calories), can ultimately decrease receptor sensitivity
to insulin, leading to insulin resistance, and, ultimately, Type 2
diabetes. In fact, Type 2 diabetes represents about 90% of all diabetes
cases throughout the world.]{.mark}

[Two of the most important therapeutic modalities for Type 2 diabetics
are weight loss, if necessary, and regular participation in physical
activity because it resensitises the cell receptors. In fact, weight
loss equivalent to 10% of overall body weight is enough to substantially
reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, and among people with
Type 2 diabetes, similar weight loss dramatically improves the
disease.]{.mark}

**During exercise**

[During exercise, hormonal regulation of blood sugar becomes a little
more complex. The presence of exercising hormones like norepinephrine
and epinephrine (adrenaline) in circulation bind to receptors in the
pancreas to inhibit much of the production of insulin. This occurs
because exercise is a catabolic event that relies on the release of
stored energy to use for work, and insulin is an anabolic hormone that
normally functions to build energy stores and prevents their breakdown
or release. In other words, exercise and circulating insulin are not
events that can or should happen simultaneously.]{.mark}

[If insulin is suppressed during exercise, yet needed to move glucose
into cells, then why do individuals ingest carbohydrates (e.g., drinks
or food) during exercise?]{.mark}

[As discussed, certain cells like muscle, liver, and fat cells rely on
that insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) pathway for moving nutrients
into the cell during resting conditions, but when insulin production and
release is suppressed (i.e., during exercise), these cells rely on a
second, non-insulin mediated glucose uptake (NIMGU) pathway to help move
glucose into the cell. During exercise, this pathway can increase
glucose uptake rates into the cell significantly (i.e., more than the
IMGU pathway), which can lower blood sugar levels if it is not carefully
managed.]{.mark}

[During exercise, epinephrine, norepinephrine and glucagon levels all
increase to stimulate glycogenolysis and glucose release from the liver
into the blood. But accelerated glucose uptake into muscle cells can
pose a major problem if blood glucose levels drop too much. Remember,
red blood cells can only use glucose as a fuel and they rely exclusively
on blood glucose as that fuel. Cortisol is tasked with preserving both
blood sugar and liver glycogen, considering how the liver is the only
organ that can release glucose into circulation. Under scenarios of
prolonged exercise, glycogen depletion, or carbohydrate or caloric
restriction, cortisol levels elevate to preserve liver glycogen, which,
in turn, preserves blood sugar. Cortisol stimulates lipolysis to slow
carbohydrate utilisation rates, but it also strives to produce
much-needed glucose via gluconeogenesis. It derives its substrate for
conversion from various sources, but primarily from amino acids that
originated as muscle tissue, or from protein food sources, if they are
ingested around the same time the glucose manufacture occurs (e.g.,
during exercise).]{.mark}

### Glycaemic index

[It was previously discussed how excessive energy intake can elevate
insulin, which can desensitise insulin receptors embedded within the
cell membranes, and how this advances the potential for insulin
resistance, pre-diabetes, or perhaps even Type 2 diabetes. But, do all
carbohydrates exact the same toll on the body by virtue of their insulin
response? The answer is no. To help understand the uniquely different
effects of each carbohydrate source, one needs to understand the concept
of glycaemic index.]{.mark}

[The glycaemic index (GI score) is a relative ranking of a food's effect
on blood glucose (blood sugar) 2 hours after the consumption of that
food. The scoring index assigns a value of 100 to represent glucose, the
reference food for this ranking system. A score of 50 would essentially
reflect a food that elevates blood sugar at half the rate of glucose.
Low GI foods are classified as foods with scores under 55, medium GI
foods are classified as foods with scores between 56 and 69, and high GI
foods are classified as foods with scores above 69. There are some key
observations to note:]{.mark}

- [Not all simple sugars have high GI scores (e.g. fructose or sucrose).
  Fructose is absorbed more slowly and needs conversion to glucose in
  the liver. This subsequently lowers its GI score.]{.mark}

- [Not all complex carbohydrates have low GI scores (e.g. instant rice,
  instant mashed potatoes or cornflakes). Removing fibre can increase a
  food's GI score.]{.mark}

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[As illustrated, the GI score ranking is not as simple as distinguishing
simple from complex carbohydrates. Many factors can affect a food's GI
score. Examples include the following:]{.mark}

- [Monosaccharide form --- glucose versus fructose]{.mark}

- [Polysaccharide form --- amylopectin versus amylose]{.mark}

- [Food form (liquid versus solid) --- Foods leaving the stomach
  generally have a semi-liquid, gooey consistency (e.g. like cream of
  wheat). Solid foods will, therefore, remain in the stomach longer
  until they reach that consistency. However, semi-liquid (smoothies or
  pulp) or liquid forms of food (juicing) empty the stomach much
  faster.]{.mark}

- [Degree of processing and cooking --- This alters GI scores in both
  directions. Separating nutrients from fibre during cooking (boiling)
  can raise GI scores while making starch more resistant via repeated
  heating or cooking can lower GI scores (e.g., reheating pizza where it
  becomes rubber-like).]{.mark}

- [Presence of other nutrients (e.g. fibre, protein or fats) --- This
  slows gastric emptying and digestion, which lower the food's GI
  score.]{.mark}

- [Human variability in digestion and absorption]{.mark}

[All being said, there are many limitations to implementing GI in
practice because most people rarely eat many of these foods alone and
instead enjoy a mixed meal (e.g., peanut on bread or milk with oats).
Furthermore, considering how GI demonstrates varied responses among
people, and how it has limited clinical applicability as a stand-alone
score for a single food, it should be used with caution.]{.mark}

[Another consideration overlooked with GI scores relates to the quantity
of a carbohydrate food consumed, which can influence blood sugar
responses. While GI scores rank the effect of a carbohydrate sample on
raising blood glucose, glycaemic load (GL) also considers the quantity
of the food consumed. Because both GI and the amount of the
carbohydrates consumed influence overall blood sugar responses,
consideration of their collective impact should theoretically provide a
better estimate of how much insulin might be needed to correct a blood
sugar response.]{.mark}

[As an example, examine baby carrots, which have a GI score of
approximately 92 versus corn which has a GI score of approximately 60.
If examined alone, logic dictates that carrots would require more
insulin to correct. However, if only six grams of carrots were eaten,
but 20 grams of corn was eaten, the amount of insulin needed for corn
might be greater. A method for calculating GL exists, but there is no
universal consensus among experts on the validity and significance of
calculating numerical GL scores.]{.mark}

[Recent evidence has also come out to suggest that both the GI and GL
may not be overly reliable. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that
each person has a substantially different response to the same foods.
For example, in this study, giving two different people a slice of bread
yielded completely different glycaemic responses. One person had a very
large spike in blood glucose, while the other person had virtually no
spike in blood glucose. The same thing occurred when they fed different
people ice cream (Zeevi et al., 2015). This suggests that while GI and
GL may help us better understand foods, they may not be overly robust
tools to use for every client.]{.mark}

### Current versus recommended intakes

[The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for carbohydrates for adults
aged 19 years and older is set at 130 grams per day (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).
Generally, this is considered the minimum amount needed to maintain
normal metabolism and utilisation of fuels. However, the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is set at 45
to 65% of the total caloric intake daily, which might be at least double
the RDA.]{.mark}

[This means that if a person was consuming 2,400 calories daily,
carbohydrates should represent 1,080 to 1,560 calories of that total (45
to 65%). Considering how four calories equals one gram of carbohydrates,
this would amount to 270 to 390 grams a day, values that far exceed the
minimal RDA. This demonstrates the confusion with having and following
multiple guidelines, because 130 grams and over 270 grams represent a
significant differential in calories.]{.mark}

**Current intakes**

[Although the average intake of carbohydrates in the American diet
represents approximately 47.4% and 49.6% of total calories for men and
women, respectively, it is the absolute or total amount of food ingested
that is too high, representing a surplus of calories in our diets. One
could also argue that perhaps the choice of carbohydrates many consume
are less than desirable. One major concern is the excessive amount of
sugar consumed, which is approximated by the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) to be between 150 to 170 pounds of refined sugars per
adult per year, an estimate that has increased by 39% since 1950. This
is equivalent to approximately 1,800 cans of 12 oz. (355 mL) of soft
drink per year. In fact, the United States consumes more sugar than any
other country in the world. The largest sources of sugar intake
represent those found in beverages, excluding milk and juices, and
snacks and sweets.]{.mark}

[When examining sugar intake and the current dietary guidelines, it is
important to first distinguish total sugar from added sugar. Added
sugars represent all sugars derived from food sources that *exclude*
those sugars found naturally in fruits and dairy. Although these
naturally occurring sugars represent healthier options given the
presence of the other nutrients (e.g., vitamins and minerals), excessive
intake of these foods can also increase the risk for diabetes in the
same manner as added sugars (Imamura et al., 2015).]{.mark}

[The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a guideline in 2015
recommending that adults and children reduce their daily intake of added
sugar to under 10% of total kcal. WHO also suggested that additional
benefits are attained by further reducing that intake to under 5% or
about 25 grams / 0.88 ounces (6 teaspoons).]{.mark}

[The following tables list the quantities of sugar between various
beverages and juices; between juices, blended fruits, and juicing; and
between sweets and food bars. Consider how similar the quantities of
sugar between each are, although perceptions of one versus the other are
hugely different (i.e., healthy versus unhealthy). Furthermore, examine
the caloric density differences between a 12-ounce serving of fresh
juice, blended fruit, and juicing. Juicing simply adds a greater density
of sugar because of the quantity of fruits and/or vegetables needed to
make juice (1 piece of fruit = 4 oz of juice or about 120 mL) eliminates
the fibre.]{.mark}
