# Protein

[Protein is one of the most discussed topics in sports nutrition, and
for good reason. It is the second-most abundant molecule in fat-free
bodily tissues (water being the most abundant). It plays a pivotal role
in exercise recovery and it is involved in nearly all bodily functions
and processes. Proteins are responsible for many functions throughout
the body, including acid-base balance, energy production, cell
signalling, and nutrient transport. For these reasons and many more,
protein is an essential dietary nutrient for healthy living.]{.mark}

## Protein structure

[Similar to other organic molecules, protein is made from the elements
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. However, protein is unique from the
nutrients carbohydrate and fat because it is composed of nitrogen, as
well. The elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N)
combine to form the building blocks of protein, which are known as amino
acids.]{.mark}

### Amino acids

[All proteins are composed of amino acids. There are hundreds of amino
acids in nature, yet there are just 20 amino acids that the human body
requires to perform its various functions. Amino acid structure and
arrangement has five components: a central carbon, a carboxyl group
(organic acid -- COOH), a hydrogen, an amino group (NH2), and a side
chain (R group). The side chain is what makes each individual amino acid
unique, and, therefore, it is different between every amino acid. For
example, glycine only has a single hydrogen in the side-chain position,
while leucine's side chain is a more complex carbon and hydrogen
structure. Nutrition Coaches must know whether an amino acid is
nonessential, conditionally essential, or essential in the human
diet.]{.mark}

[Essential amino acids (EAA) must be consumed in the diet because they
are necessary for bodily functions and cannot be synthesized within the
body. There are nine EAAs, which include three branched chain amino
acids. There are also six conditionally essential amino acids. Unlike
EAAs, conditionally essential amino acids are considered nonessential
under normal circumstances and can be synthesised in the body; however,
under certain physiological conditions, requirements can outweigh their
availability or rate of synthesis, making them essential for some
individuals. When this occurs, the conditionally essential amino acid
must be obtained in the diet. Healthy adults typically do not need to be
concerned about consuming enough conditionally essential amino acids, as
they only become essential during infancy, injury, disease or trauma.
Nonessential amino acids can be synthesised in the body from other amino
acids, typically the EAAs, so they do not need to be consumed in the
diet.]{.mark}

[Because the conditionally essential amino acids so rarely become
essential for individuals, which amino acids to classify as
conditionally essential remains a debated topic. For example, some
experts advocate that serine be added to the list of conditionally
essential amino acids, while others argue that amino acids only become
conditionally essential in the presence of disease. Clients should
always be referred to their primary care doctor to have bloodwork
analysed if any concerns regarding amino acid deficiency exist.]{.mark}

[Another classification system for amino acids is based on their
potential to become glucose or ketones for use in energy metabolism.
These are known as glucogenic or ketogenic amino acids. While amino
acids should not be relied on for optimal energy production, they can be
broken down preferentially over fatty acids in times of negative energy
balance when more intense activity needs to be sustained and
carbohydrate availability is insufficient. Glucogenic amino acids can
have their carbon backbone converted to glucose by the process of
gluconeogenesis, or they can be converted to an intermediate compound
that may enter the Krebs cycle directly. Ketogenic amino acids may
become acetoacetate (a ketone body) or acetyl-CoA prior to entering the
Krebs cycle for the generation of ATP. Some amino acids will always be
specifically glucogenic or ketogenic, while others can be both
glucogenic and ketogenic, with the outcome depending on which stage of
metabolism they enter.]{.mark}

### Protein synthesis

[When proteins are consumed, they must first be broken down into amino
acids by digestion to be absorbed in the intestines. From there, they
can be transported to peripheral tissues and recombined to form new
proteins such as collagen, myosin, and hemoglobin. Protein synthesis is
the process by which amino acids are joined together to form proteins,
such as lean tissues, like muscle.]{.mark}

[The amino acids bond together by a chemical reaction called dehydration
synthesis. In a dehydration synthesis reaction, a hydrogen from one
amino acid and a hydroxyl group (OH) from a second amino acid are
removed and joined together by a peptide bond to form the newly
synthesised molecule and the byproduct of water (H2O). It is called
dehydration synthesis because a water molecule is removed, thus
de*hydrating* the molecule. The opposite process is known as hydrolysis,
which occurs during digestion when proteins are broken down to amino
acids.]{.mark}

[When two amino acids are joined, it is known as a dipeptide. When three
amino acids are joined, it is known as a tripeptide. When between four
and nine amino acids join it is called an oligopeptide, and chains of 10
or more amino acids are called polypeptides. Bodily proteins are most
often formed by at least 50 amino acids. The human body is in a constant
state of both protein synthesis (anabolic) *and* protein breakdown
(catabolic). When an individual is gaining muscle mass, their rate of
muscle protein synthesis is greater than their body's rate of muscle
protein breakdown. Conversely, someone who becomes inactive for an
extended period of time will have greater rates of muscle protein
breakdown as the body returns to equilibrium.]{.mark}

[Muscle proteins vary in size, shape, and function. The three major
muscle proteins are myosin, actin, and titin, which all contain
different amino acid compositions. Titin has about 30,000 amino acids,
myosin has about 6,000 amino acids, and actin has about 400 amino acids.
Myosin uses energy from ATP to grab actin and flex in unison with many
other myosin proteins to produce a muscle contraction. Titin helps
provide a muscle's elasticity so it can return to its resting length
following muscle contractions. It is so large because it stretches over
the whole muscle cell, whereas myosin and actin go about halfway. Myosin
is much larger than actin due to its more complex function.]{.mark}

## Protein digestion and absorption

[The first step in protein breakdown is denaturation, changing the shape
of a protein but not its primary structure. Denaturation occurs in
response to many factors such as temperature, pH, and enzymes, all of
which are at work during protein digestion and absorption. For most
protein-dense foods, this process begins with cooking the food. The
applied heat denatures proteins, which must occur within the body
eventually, either by mastication (chewing) or in the acidic environment
of the stomach. Even cutting food up into smaller pieces is, in a way,
facilitating digestive processes by reducing the amount of necessary
mastication. Unlike with carbohydrates and fats, enzymes for protein in
the saliva are relatively inactive and do little to aid in
digestion.]{.mark}

[When you want to see protein denaturation in action, fry an egg! When
the clear egg white heats up and turns opaque as it cooks, you are
witnessing protein denaturation. Protein denaturation does not make the
protein within the food useless, as is often suggested. Many forms of
cooking jumpstart the process of breaking down proteins and facilitating
more efficient digestion.]{.mark}

[However, chewing food causes the stomach wall to release gastrin in
anticipation of the digestion process. In turn, gastrin causes the
release of hydrochloric acid and the hormone pepsinogen in the stomach.
When pepsinogen contacts the hydrochloric acid, it releases the active
enzyme pepsin. Together, hydrochloric acid and pepsin begin the
enzymatic breakdown of protein in the stomach. Hydrochloric acid
denatures the protein and pepsin begins breaking the very long
polypeptide chains into smaller peptide chains (hydrolysis reaction).
Those smaller peptide chains then move to the small intestine for the
next step in digestion.]{.mark}

[As the food passes from the stomach into the duodenum of the small
intestine, the intestinal cells release the hormones secretin and
cholecystokinin. Secretin mostly acts as a regulator of digestion,
reducing acid release to help restore pH when eating ceases.
Cholecystokinin acts on the pancreas, which releases the protease
enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase into the
small intestine. The protease enzymes continue to break down peptide
chains into even shorter peptides. Finally, peptidases and
aminopeptidases reduce the size to single amino acids and dipeptides,
which can then be absorbed from the small intestine into the hepatic
portal vein, carrying them to the liver.]{.mark}

[Within the liver, amino acids may be used for protein synthesis, broken
down into urea (urine waste), converted to carbohydrate or fat
(gluconeogenesis or ketogenesis), metabolized for energy, or released
into the peripheral blood stream for use throughout the body. While the
maximum amount of protein that can be absorbed in one meal is yet to be
determined, about 85% of plant protein and 95% of animal protein is
absorbed and very little protein is found in excrement. Any remaining
proteins and peptides that make it past the small intestine and into the
large intestine (colon) are fermented by bacteria and secreted as
waste.]{.mark}

## Protein function

[While fats and carbohydrates may be thought of as energy
macronutrients, protein is more of a structural and functional
macronutrient, forming bodily structures and serving many necessary
bodily functions. Although it is possible for protein to be metabolized
for energy, this only occurs when there is an abundance of protein in
the diet and/or when there is not enough carbohydrate to support normal
energy production (negative energy balance). Protein and amino acids are
primarily used to create bodily tissues; to form enzymes and cellular
transporters, as cell signals; to maintain fluid balance; to buffer
acids and bases (pH balance), in the production of hormones and
neurotransmitters; and in the immune system.]{.mark}

**Bodily tissues**

[Most bodily protein is located within the musculoskeletal system.
However, keep in mind there is no true storage depot for protein like
there is for carbohydrates (glycogen stored in muscle tissue and the
liver) or fats (adipose tissue, i.e., body fat). Rather, proteins make
up the physical structure of the muscles and bones. This is why amino
acids are not considered a primary source of energy because the only way
to supply them (aside from eating) is by breaking down non-fat bodily
tissues.]{.mark}

[Along with the mineral calcium, bones are formed from very strong
collagen proteins, which are also found in the skin, tendons, ligaments,
and joints. Collagen's molecular structure is a triple helix, which
gives it great tensile strength. Collagen protein's function is to
provide structural integrity. The reason collagen is so effective at
being strong and flexible is because it is formed from many small amino
acids (glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline), which can move around
without breaking their bonds. Usually found alongside collagen is
elastin protein, which provides elasticity so tissues can bend but not
break. Muscle proteins myosin, actin, and titin are another large
repository for body proteins that enable movement. Finally, keratin is
another tough protein found in human hair and fingernails.]{.mark}

**Enzymes and cellular transporters**

[Nearly all enzymes are made from protein. Enzymes are catalysts for
chemical reactions and are critical for carrying out many functions
within the body, especially in digestion and metabolism. Enzymes are
present in saliva, stomach and intestinal fluids, blood, and throughout
the cells of the body. For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase is an enzyme
involved in the metabolism of glucose. It converts the end product of
anaerobic glycolysis, pyruvate, to acetyl-CoA for use in the Krebs cycle
within the mitochondria. Without pyruvate dehydrogenase, the energy that
humans are able to generate from a glucose molecule would be severely
limited.]{.mark}

[Cellular transporters are similar to enzymes. However, instead of
catalysing a reaction, they are more like doorways in cell membranes.
One of the most discussed transporters in biology is the
sodium--potassium pump. The sodium--potassium pump actively (using ATP)
transports potassium into the cell and sodium out of the cell to create
a gradient that the cell can use for other transporters and electrical
signaling. This protein-based cellular transporter is, in essence, what
allows these electrolytes to do their job within the cells, maintaining
the pathway by which the nervous system sends its electrical signals for
muscles to contract. Other cellular transporters work passively (without
ATP) to allow nutrients to cross cellular membranes.]{.mark}

[Proteins are also critical for transporting a wide range of nutrients
throughout the body. For example, haemoglobin is a protein in red blood
cells that binds to and transports both oxygen and the metabolic waste
product of carbon dioxide. Another example is lipoproteins, which are
molecules that make the transport of lipids (fats) throughout the body
possible. The most well-known example of this is cholesterol. The
lipoproteins have historically received negative attention for their
role in cardiovascular health (or risk), yet they perform an essential
bodily function by moving lipids between the liver, adipose tissue, and
other tissues or organs so they may be metabolized or stored.]{.mark}

**Cell signalling**

[The concentration of individual amino acids can be interpreted by the
nervous system as a signal to perform certain functions. For example, an
increase in the amino acid leucine has been shown to signal muscle cells
to begin synthesizing new proteins when the other necessary amino acids
are present. Leucine in isolation will not build muscle, but
supplementing leucine into an otherwise high-protein diet can help
enhance muscle hypertrophy. Not only can proteins and amino acids be
signals themselves, but they often form the cellular receptors and
sensors, as well. These receptors can respond to many different stimuli
outside the cell and relay a message inside the cell.]{.mark}

**Fluid balance**

[Proteins help maintain fluid balance on the cellular level as part of
their role as transporters across cell membranes, allowing water to move
between the cells and the blood. Fluid balance is also managed by the
protein albumin, the most abundant protein in blood plasma. Albumin is
present in the blood but much less abundant within soft tissue. This
creates a concentration gradient that helps pull excess fluid from
bodily tissues back into the bloodstream by osmosis.]{.mark}

**pH balance**

[Proteins and amino acids help regulate the body's acid--base balance by
binding to free hydroxyl groups or hydrogen ions in the blood to help
maintain a neutral pH. Hemoglobin is one of the most well-known proteins
that assist with this. As a side effect of its role in binding to carbon
dioxide to transport it out of the body as waste, it prevents the CO2
from forming carbonic acid and lowering blood pH. The protein's presence
within the blood, cell, and other fluids provide over half of the
buffering power in the body.]{.mark}

[Can amino acids prevent someone from *staying alkaline*? The short
answer is no. Amino acids contain both alkaline (basic) and acidic
functional groups. With few exceptions, like the stomach, the body is
already slightly alkaline with a blood pH of about 7.4 and amino acids
are a major factor in maintaining the slightly alkaline pH.]{.mark}

**Hormones and neurotransmitters**

[Many hormones are derived from amino acids, which are known as peptide
hormones. For example, human growth hormone (produced in the pituitary
gland) contains 191 amino acids. Other examples of peptide hormones can
be found throughout the body, such as insulin (produced in the
pancreas), gastrin (produced in the stomach), and leptin (produced
within adipose tissue).]{.mark}

[Peptide hormones often also act as neurotransmitters. While similar to
hormones, in that they serve as chemical messengers throughout the body,
they are classified differently. Neurotransmitters are part of the
nervous system, while hormones are part of the endocrine system. A
single peptide hormone can belong to either system depending on how it
is behaving. For example, oxytocin is a small peptide hormone that can
also function as a neurotransmitter. As a hormone, for example, oxytocin
acts within the mammary glands to signal the release of breast milk
after giving birth. As a neurotransmitter, oxytocin acts on the
prefrontal cortex to stimulate feelings of social connection and sexual
attraction, giving rise to its nickname as the love hormone (even though
its function in this capacity is within the central nervous system as a
neurotransmitter and not the endocrine system as a hormone). Other
peptides that function as neurotransmitters include epinephrine,
glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine.]{.mark}

**Immune system**

[Like red blood cells with haemoglobin, white blood cells also require
protein to become functional. The white blood cells themselves also use
proteins to fight infection and disease. In response to an infection,
the white blood cell produces antibodies, which are proteins, to protect
the body from sickness and disease while leaving friendly microbes and
bacteria alone.]{.mark}

[Having adequate dietary protein can help prevent sickness and
infection. A study conducted on trained cyclists undergoing 2 weeks of
high-volume, high-intensity training and divided into either a
high-protein treatment (3 grams per kilogram bodyweight) or a
normal-protein treatment (1.5 grams per kilogram bodyweight) found that
the increased training volume bogged down the immune system. During the
normal protein treatment, cyclists reported more symptoms of
upper-respiratory tract infection than during the high-protein
treatment, and having greater protein intake maintained better white
blood cell function.]{.mark}

## Protein dietary needs

[Obtaining adequate protein in the diet is essential for athletes and
non-athletes alike. For non-athletes, dietary protein is required for
the myriad of health functions previously discussed. For active
exercisers and athletes, additional protein intake is required for the
repair and recovery of muscle tissue, as well. Depending on the goals of
the active individual, they may need more protein in their diet than the

**Total daily protein requirements**

[The total daily protein requirement depends largely on the body size,
activity level or sport, and body composition goals of the individual.
Therefore, it is best to recommend total daily protein intakes on a gram
of protein per kilogram of bodyweight basis. In general, individuals
need between 0.8 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per
day. Inactive persons require less protein than active persons, and
those exercising with greater duration or intensity will require more
protein than those exercising with less duration or intensity.
Additionally, more protein is required to recover from strength training
than from cardiovascular training.]{.mark}

[The recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram (0.013 ounces
of protein per pound) body weight is a daily minimum *need* that may be
as high as 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram (0.019 ounces of protein
per pound) of body weight in non-exercising persons based on new
evidence. Exceeding the proposed dietary protein need poses few, if any,
negative consequences. Consuming up to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram
of body weight is an acceptable goal, even for sedentary persons, and it
is likely that a greater percentage of calories coming from protein will
facilitate health goals.]{.mark}

[Remember to always teach protein recommendations broadly so that
clients can make their own nutritional decisions for themselves.]{.mark}

[When working in Australia, always refer to the [ADG Eat for Health
Calculators](https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/eat-health-calculators) to
assist with the understanding of macronutrient breakdowns.]{.mark}

[Individuals who are seeking weight loss often lose muscle mass and fat
mass concurrently and in relatively equal proportions, with typical
calorie restricted diets. Maintaining as much muscle mass as possible
while dieting can be achieved with greater protein intake (at least 1.8
to 2.2 grams per kilogram) and regular resistance training. Several
research studies have verified that simultaneous loss of fat and
maintenance of lean body mass is. This requires careful consideration of
calorie and protein intake and alignment with a well-designed resistance
training program. Those beginning a fat-loss program with a more
athletic and muscular physique may be able to lose fat mass with more
normal caloric intakes.]{.mark}

[Incorporating high-protein snacks, whether they are advertised as such
or not, may be an effective strategy as part of a weight-loss plan. Do
not be fooled, though; calories are the most important factor in weight
loss, gain, and maintenance. Having a snack such as a low-carb, low-fat
protein bar can certainly help with weight loss by curbing appetite
between meals. However, products that simply add protein into a snack
that otherwise has the nutrition profile of a chocolate bar (high
sugar/high fat) can be counterproductive to someone who is trying to
lose body fat.]{.mark}

[Another special consideration for adjusting protein intake is for
ageing adults. They are less responsive to dietary protein for the
purposes of maintaining or increasing lean muscle (anabolic resistance).
This is especially true for the older adult who is also physically
inactive. It may be more appropriate to recommend that individuals 65
years of age and older consume at least 0.9 to 1.6 grams of protein per
kilogram of bodyweight.]{.mark}

[Athletes who are training with unusually high volume or intensity for a
brief period of time, such as during a training camp, may have even
greater protein needs than under normal training circumstances. During
this time, it is appropriate to consider increasing protein intake in
proportion to the increase in calorie intake as needed to meet the
energy demands of the activity. For example, a 60-kilogram athlete
training for a triathlon may regularly train for 12 hours per week,
consume upwards of 3,500 calories or more per day, and eat around 120
grams of protein per day.]{.mark}

[It is important to understand the difference between minimum needs and
optimal amounts of protein, including the differences between government
recommendations and suggestions from the scientific literature. Know how
recommendations change based on activity type and volume.]{.mark}

### Protein quality

[The second-most important factor in meeting protein requirements is the
type of protein that is consumed. Protein quality refers to the number
of essential amino acids contained within, and the digestibility of, a
protein-containing food. Protein quality also refers to the completeness
of a protein. A complete protein is a food source that contains all of
the essential amino acids in appropriate quantities. In general, animal
proteins are complete proteins and plant proteins are incomplete
proteins, with the exception of soy, which is also a complete
protein.]{.mark}

[Vegetarians and vegans often do not consume complete proteins, and,
therefore, need to be conscious of consuming a variety of protein
sources to meet essential amino acid (EAA) needs. A common example of
mixed protein sources are rice and beans. Rice proteins are poor sources
of lysine, but they are rich in cysteine and methionine. Beans have
enough lysine, but they are poor sources of methionine and cysteine.
Thus, they can be combined to form a complete protein in a single meal.
Because of this, they are called complementary proteins. In general,
people following a vegetarian or vegan diet may pair grains or
nuts/seeds with legumes to obtain sufficient EAAs.]{.mark}

[Other examples of complementary proteins include wheat/peanut butter,
pasta/peas, and lentils/almonds. Complementary protein sources may also
simply be consumed in different meals on the same day, as sufficient
total daily EAA intake can still be achieved even if the individual
amino acids are consumed across meals over a 24-hour period. That being
said, it is always important to encourage clients to eat from a variety
of protein sources, regardless of the dietary approach they may be
following.]{.mark}

**Special Consideration-Leucine**

[Protein quality assessment may be taken one step further when working
with athletes or recreationally active individuals. The amino acid
leucine is a primary factor for increasing muscle protein synthesis to
facilitate muscle recovery and growth. Of all the amino acids present in
a protein, leucine is the only one that is independently capable of
enhancing muscle anabolism. However, it is important to understand that
leucine is operating as a signal and *all* of the amino acids are still
necessary to form proteins. Therefore, a protein's quality may be
evaluated based on its leucine content when muscle mass maintenance or
growth is a primary goal.]{.mark}

[Leucine is capable of enhancing muscle protein synthesis signalling for
a period of about 3 hours after ingestion, and the *optimal* dose to
maximise protein synthesis is 0.05 grams of leucine per kilogram of body
weight.]{.mark}

### Protein timing

[Most individuals do not need to concern themselves with the concept of
protein timing as they will naturally consume adequate protein by eating
balanced meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, small
improvements in long-term physiological adaptations to exercise may be
obtained from strategic timing of protein ingestion throughout the day,
as well as before, during, and after training. Such strategies should be
reserved for thoroughly dedicated individuals (i.e., athletes), as
current scientific progress only supports the strategies in
theory.]{.mark}

[For example, a study comparing the rates of muscle protein synthesis
over a 12-hour period found that four servings of 20 grams of whey
protein was superior to the timing strategies of two servings of 40
grams of whey protein and eight servings of 10 grams of whey protein
equally spaced over the 12-hour period. This is due, in part, to a
protein threshold in combination with the kinetics of nutrition and
protein synthesis. Ten grams (0.35 ounces) of protein was not enough to
stimulate protein synthesis----participants never crossed the threshold.
However, they did with 20 grams (0.7 ounces) and 40 grams (1.4 ounces);
and with 20 grams (0.7 ounces), they crossed the threshold more
frequently, once every 3 hours compared to once every 6 hours. Three
hours seems to be about as long as an anabolic signal from a
high-protein meal lasts.]{.mark}

![](media/image1.png){width="6.267716535433071in"
height="7.819444444444445in"}

[In another study design, participants ingested equal amounts of protein
during each of three meals (about 30 grams / 1.06 ounces each), or they
consumed protein in a skewed distribution, during which about 10 to 15
grams (0.35 to 0.53 ounces) were consumed with breakfast and lunch and
about 65 grams (2.3 ounces) were consumed with dinner, but the total
amount of protein was still the same. Those with an even protein
distribution had 25% greater rates of muscle protein synthesis
throughout the day (Mamerow et al., 2014). Such protein timing
strategies may also be useful for long-term improvements in overall body
composition in overweight or obese individuals. Termed *proteinpacing*
by Arciero and colleagues (2016), the strategy consists of six meals per
day with 30% of daily calories from protein compared to standard
recommendations of three meals per day with 15% of daily calories from
protein. Protein pacing enhances total, visceral, and abdominal fat loss
and muscle mass maintenance during 3 months of calorie restriction and 9
months of maintenance.]{.mark}

[Therefore, 24-hour net muscle protein synthesis may be optimal if
stimulated with dietary protein (containing leucine) every 3 hours. This
notion was further solidified in a 2018 review on the topic of how
protein should be distributed throughout the day for muscle gain,
arriving at two key points: every meal should contain *at least* 0.4
grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and *at least* four meals
should be consumed throughout the day.]{.mark}

[Consuming protein prior to exercise may attenuate rates of muscle
catabolism (Bird, Tarpenning & Marino, 2006; Tipton et al., 2007; Tipton
et al., 2001). However, pre- and intra-workout protein consumption are
typically not emphasised if the individual has eaten a meal 1 to 3 hours
prior to training. Protein consumption during exercise may be of some
importance for very-long training sessions or athletic competitions
(e.g., races lasting longer than 3 to 4 hours). Consuming small
quantities of protein or amino acids during endurance events can limit
muscle breakdown, serve as an alternative fuel substrate, and reduce
muscle soreness (Bird et al., 2006; Greer, Woodard, White, Arguello, &
Haymes, 2007). A beverage containing 1 to 2% protein is sufficient for
intra-workout endurance purposes (Koopman et al., 2004; Saunders,
2007).]{.mark}

[Post-workout protein consumption with carbohydrates in a 3:1 or 4:1
ratio of carbohydrates to protein can accelerate the replenishment of
muscle glycogen (Ivy et al., 2002; Morifuji, Kanda, Koga, Kawanaka &
Higuchi, 2010; Tarnopolsky et al., 1997; Van Loon, Saris, Kruijshoop &
Wagenmakers, 2000). This is of relevance for endurance athletes who
train the same muscle groups during each training session (e.g.,
marathon runners), athletes with multiple training sessions per day, and
for multi-day competitions. Although commonplace in popular culture,
post-workout protein consumption for the purposes of increasing muscle
is actually of less importance.]{.mark}

[Several investigations have observed increased rates of muscle protein
synthesis when consuming protein 1 to 2 hours after resistance training;
however, only a few studies have found that muscle gain is enhanced over
time when protein is consumed post-workout and total daily protein
intake is controlled. A meta-analysis of 20 studies for muscle growth
and 23 studies for muscle strength found no statistically significant
effect of post-workout protein consumption when total daily protein
intake is equal (Schoenfeld, Aragon, & Krieger, 2013).]{.mark}

[However, if the post-workout protein consumption increases the total
protein intake for the day, muscle growth may be enhanced. In practical
terms, this means that most individuals do not need to be concerned
about consuming protein shortly after performing resistance exercise.
Instead, they should be focussed primarily on total daily protein
intake.]{.mark}

\"Although commonplace in popular culture, post-workout protein
consumption for the purposes of increasing muscle is actually of less
importance.\"

Getting Technical

[Statistical significance does not mean practical relevance.
Post-workout protein consumption may not yield such a robust effect that
the statistics will support its practice, but consuming protein after
resistance exercise may still lead to a net-positive gain in muscle mass
over time that may be considered relevant to an individual. Furthermore,
while applied observations of muscle size or strength do not firmly
support the practice of post-workout protein shakes, mechanistic
research (examining rates of muscle protein synthesis) provides further
insight. For resistance training novices, post-workout protein may not
affect muscle protein synthesis, yet in resistance trained individuals,
post-workout protein does further enhance rates of muscle protein
synthesis. Thus, the recommendation to consume protein after training
can be reserved for more well-trained individuals (Damas et al., 2016;
Mori, 2014).]{.mark}

**Protein myths and hot topics**

[As with many other topics in nutrition, protein is subjected to a
number of myths. In most cases, research is insufficient to provide a
clear answer one way or another, or research may have recently become
sufficient, but adoption of the new idea is slow. Myths are the result
of conjecture. However, there is substantial scientific data available
to help us address some of the more common protein myths.]{.mark}
