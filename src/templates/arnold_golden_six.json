      "long_term_reality": "Arnold trained for 8 years before his first Mr. Olympia. This 12-week program is step 1 of a multi-year journey. Be patient.",

    "frequently_asked_questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "Can I add exercises to the Golden Six?",
        "answer": "No. The program is called the Golden SIX, not the Golden Ten. Adding exercises reduces recovery and dilutes focus. Trust the program."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Can I train 4-5 days per week instead of 3?",
        "answer": "No. You grow when you rest. More is not better for beginners. 3x per week is optimal. Advanced lifters can train more because they've adapted over years."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What if I can't do chin-ups?",
        "answer": "Use the lat pulldown machine at 70-80% of your bodyweight, or do barbell pullovers, or do negative chin-ups (jump up, lower slowly). Work toward unassisted chin-ups."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Can I do this program at home?",
        "answer": "You need a barbell, weights, squat rack, bench, and pull-up bar minimum. If you have these, yes. If not, you need a gym."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How long can I run this program?",
        "answer": "12 weeks is ideal. You can extend to 16 weeks if still making progress. After that, you need more volume and variety."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Should I do cardio?",
        "answer": "Light cardio (walking, easy cycling) on rest days is fine. Don't do intense cardio that interferes with recovery. 2-3 sessions of 20-30 minutes maximum."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What if I'm not getting stronger every week?",
        "answer": "Check: Are you eating enough? Sleeping enough? Using proper form? If yes to all, take a deload week and try again. Progress isn't always linear."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Can women do this program?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. The same principles apply. Women may progress slightly slower on upper body but can often match or exceed men on lower body progression."
