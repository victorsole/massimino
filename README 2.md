## 📝 Language Style Guide (UI Copy)

- Use “Athlete” in all user‑facing copy where traditional tools would say “Client”.
- Keep “CLIENT” for technical contexts only (e.g., role values, database fields, API params), and for code terms like `use client`, “Prisma client”, or “HTTP client”.
- When displaying a user’s role, map `CLIENT → Athlete`, `TRAINER → Trainer`, `ADMIN → Admin`.

- **AI Content Moderation** — Real-time message scanning (OpenAI Moderation API)
- **Anti-Harassment Policies** — Zero-tolerance flagging & reporting system
- **Professional Boundary Monitoring** — Role-based chat filters
