      bio: `Arnold Schwarzenegger is arguably the most famous bodybuilder of all time. Born in Austria in 1947, he became the youngest Mr. Universe at age 20 and went on to win 7 Mr. Olympia titles. His approach to training emphasized high volume, intensity, and the "mind-muscle connection." Arnold popularized bodybuilding worldwide and brought it into mainstream culture.`,
      trainingPhilosophy: `Arnold's training philosophy centered on "shocking the muscle" with high volume, varied exercises, and training to failure. He believed in the importance of visualization and the mind-muscle connection. His famous quote "The last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow" epitomizes his approach to intensity. He trained each body part 2-3 times per week with 15-20 sets per muscle group, using techniques like supersets, drop sets, and forced reps.`,

      bio: `Ronnie Coleman is an 8-time Mr. Olympia winner, tying Lee Haney's record. Known for his incredible strength and mass, Ronnie combined powerlifting-style training with bodybuilding volume. His famous catchphrases "Yeah buddy!" and "Lightweight baby!" became iconic in fitness culture. He worked as a police officer while competing professionally.`,
      trainingPhilosophy: `Ronnie's approach was unique in that he lifted extremely heavy weights typically associated with powerlifting, while maintaining high volume and intensity for muscle growth. He believed in going heavy on compound movements and training to absolute failure. His philosophy: "Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody wants to lift no heavy-ass weights." He trained 6 days per week with 30-40+ sets per session, often training for 2+ hours.`,

      ],
      bio: `Mike Mentzer revolutionized bodybuilding with his "Heavy Duty" high-intensity training approach. A student of philosophy and science, he applied logic and reason to training, arguing that less is more when it comes to muscle growth. His approach emphasized brief, infrequent, and intense workouts taken to absolute failure.`,
      trainingPhilosophy: `Mentzer's Heavy Duty philosophy was based on the principle that intensity, not volume, stimulates muscle growth. He advocated training each body part once every 7-14 days with only 1-2 all-out work sets per exercise, taken beyond failure using forced reps, negatives, and rest-pause techniques. His famous quote: "That last rep where you're shaking is what turns on the growth mechanism." He challenged the high-volume dogma of his era and proved results with science-based training.`,

      bio: `Dorian Yates dominated the 1990s with his incredible size and conditioning. Known for his "Blood & Guts" training philosophy, Dorian brought a new level of intensity and mass to professional bodybuilding. He trained in relative obscurity in Birmingham, England, shocking the world when he debuted on the Olympia stage. His back development is considered legendary.`,
      trainingPhilosophy: `Inspired by Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty principles, Dorian refined high-intensity training into his own system. He trained each muscle once per week with brief but brutally intense workouts lasting 45-60 minutes. Each exercise received 1-2 all-out work sets taken beyond failure using drop sets, forced reps, and negatives. His mantra: "Stimulate, don't annihilate - but when you stimulate, destroy it." He meticulously tracked every workout in journals and constantly sought to beat previous performances.`,

CBum has revolutionized how athletes connect with fans through social media, making bodybuilding more accessible and relatable.
